1,"The Traveling Journal of r/fountainpens (Approved by Moderators) Greetings, fountain pen family!

Some of you may have seen my original post proposing a pass-around journal. For anyone new to this project, you can read it here:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/fountainpens/comments/1ajukfi/passaround\_journal/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fountainpens/comments/1ajukfi/passaround_journal/)

&amp;#x200B;

Well I'm thrilled to announce that the moderating team has generously agreed to support and assist this ambitious undertaking! There is already a great deal of interested parties, but we have room for more!

For everyone who would like to be a part of this project, please read through the outline and instructions below.

I am extremely excited to get this moving, and looking forward to all the amazing entries we'll get from everyone!

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The Traveling Journal of r/fountainpens

Our sub is composed of so many unique individuals; each with their own views, experiences, talents, and creativity. All of us united in our shared passion for the remarkable writing tool that is the fountain pen. Why not capture some of that uniqueness in a single tome for sharing and preservation?

The plan is straightfoward: a physical journal will be sent from one member to another for each person to add a new entry. Whether it's a typical journal/diary type of written entry, lyrics to a favorite or meaningful song, movie/famous quotes, artwork...whatever we each feel like contributing. Periodically it will be sent back to me for archiving, then sent back out to the next member to continue the chain until the journal has been filled. There will be very few restrictions on what can be added (detailed below), and the procedure for taking part in this project is fairly simple.

&amp;#x200B;

**How To Join**

* Sign up by submitting your info using a Google Form created by me. Name, mailing and email addresses, and reddit username.
   * https://forms.gle/rT98eo9KGTV59ZV1A
* Create a free account at [asana.com](https://asana.com).
* Not required, but I highly recommend saving and subscribing to this thread for public updates.

All personal info will not be shared with anyone and used only for the purposes of this project. Additionally, each member will only have the address info of the previous and next contributor to help maintain privacy and security for everyone. That is what the Asana account is for. Asana is a project management tool. It will allow me to keep track of where the journal is, communicate with each contributor, and serve as a way to effectively and efficiently keep everything moving while maintaining as much privacy for everyone as possible.

Once we have a good sized list of contributors signed up, I will be organizing all the addresses so that the journal will stay in one country/region as long as possible to help save on shipping costs.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Rules**

* Don't sign up for the project if you are not 100% dedicated.
   * Keep in mind the timely nature of the project and be reasonably prompt with your entry and forwarding of the journal.
   * Understand there is a small financial requirement in the form of postage. Also, you might have the responsibility of sending it internationally. (Costs should be minimal, but I am only familiar with US shipping prices.)
* Entries shall not be defamatory, disparaging, overtly vulgar, or otherwise harmful/hurtful.
   * ""Overtly vulgar"" does not mean you cannot use cursing or have to refrain from nude artworks or things of that nature. Basically, don't add anything that would be considered trashy. Romance novels and fine art nudes are one thing. Porn is completely another.
* Do not deface or otherwise alter another person's entry.
* Ideally, it would be a great addition to each entry if you could list the pen(s) and ink(s) you used!

The moderators have agreed that violation of the rules will have repercussions to that contributor's membership within this sub.

&amp;#x200B;

I have two journals I am looking at that I feel will suit this project well - the Torcello or Firenze from Papuro:

[https://www.theonlinepencompany.com/us/papuro-torcello-leather-journal-burgundy-large](https://www.theonlinepencompany.com/us/papuro-torcello-leather-journal-burgundy-large)

[https://www.theonlinepencompany.com/us/papuro-firenze-leather-journal-black-large](https://www.theonlinepencompany.com/us/papuro-firenze-leather-journal-black-large)

I am open to suggestions on either, or a completely different journal. But the requirements I have are that it is a of a decent but reasonable size (around 16x22cm at largest), has at least 100 sheets (200 total pages), be unlined (especially purposeful for artwork), and have a leather/fux leather cover (this is just for aesthetic reasons).

As mentioned, the journal will periodically be sent back to me so I can archive it as we go along in case the unthinkable should happen and the journal gets lost or damaged. The ultimate goal is to create a full eBook that all sub members will be able to see.

&amp;#x200B;

That should be about it! Again, this project has full moderator support, but if anyone has any questions or concerns, please let me or them know. I hope we can get this moving soon, and I can't wait to see the results!


I also want to thank u/Old_Implement_1997 and u/pandavictus for their help along the way!

Wow! We already have quite a few signups for this! Looks like we'll be able to move forward soon! Unless anyone has any objections, I will very soon be moving forward with purchasing one of the two journals I listed. Thanks to everyone for supporting this little idea!"
1,"Sometimes, we just need this simple reminder ü§ó  "
1,"I must confess I was wrong about Kaweco I've been in the hobby on and off for over a decade, and especially lately have owned a lot of different pens from a lot of different manufacturers.

I knew about Kaweco and the popularity of the Sport and its variants, but I just thought they were ugly, uninteresting pens. I called them ""metal tampons.""

Well, a couple of weeks ago my resin pocket pen started getting cracks (any guesses which brand?). I decided to find a replacement pocket pen made out of metal. A lot of people recommend various metal versions of the Kaweco Sport and I opened my mind a bit. Ultimately I decided to try the much cheaper Hongdian M2. I liked it a lot, fantastic pen for $20.

But the other day, I happened to notice that the Kaweco Brass Sport was on sale with fine nib for $50, so I just bit the bullet and ordered one. I've been carrying it for one day so far and... I absolutely love it. It's so well-built. It's so hefty and heavy and solid feeling. It feels like an indestructible tool. The nib isn't a gusher, but that's probably ideal for a pocket pen since I will be often using it on less-than-great paper. It's a smooth writer. It's weirdly comfortable for a hexagonal pen. It just feels like quality.

I'm a convert. And yes, I like it even more than the M2, though I'll probably be rotating them both out for EDC pens since they're both really nice."
1,"Why are cheap fountain pens so much better? This is the cheapest pen I have. I had zero problems with these, but with more expensive ones like Kaweco and Conklin, I had problems with the nibs. Why is that? These are so smooth too"

1,"NPD First Sailor 21k nib I bought this out of impulse straight from Japan. 
Sailor Realo 21k nib (B). The reviews were correct, it feels like writing with a pencil. I'm in ahhh."
1,"What a weird hat Side note, try the Asvine P20: extremely smooth on a M nib, might I say as smooth as a custom 823, albeit writing thicker. It has surprisingly great QC, dropped it one off my table and was completely fine with no scratches. The piston fill stores a lot of ink, of course, and it feels shockingly solid and well built in the hand for a resin pen.

It comes in several beautiful color ways and I bought my Amber Medium nib one for $21.

Also: Faster than that other guy and drawing this hat first üòé, nah I'm just trippin I just want to draw like him"
1,"Yay Ink Diamine Honey burst, scribble purple and R&amp;K Alt Gold-grun landed today. All lovely so far and such great value!"
1,"My Sailor Collection so far with a bonus TWSBI Diamond I have found that the hand feel and nibs of the Sailor PGS series are the most comfortable for me. I have even bought several Jinhao 82s, even though their nibs are so stiff. I want to see if the regular PGs are that different than the PGSs, but I love these!"

1,Glitter galore A local webshop had a sale so I bought the Pelikan Edelstein Golden Lapis and a new TWSBI eco (dark sapphire). I thought that Emerald of Chivor had a lot of glitter. I was wrong.

1,"Some chocolatey goodness üç´ Hello, 

Kobe inks with some sweetness üç´ 

So you know about City museum gray but you didn‚Äôt know about the confectionery range. üëÄ I believe the chocolate inks are in collaboration with the Felissimo chocolate museum, and the ink colours are based on that theme - CHOCOLATE! üç≠ 

‚Ä¢Milk chocolate is a not as chocolate as I‚Äôd like it to be. It is a caramel milky brown with a beautiful amount of pink shading. 
‚Ä¢Strawberry chocolate is a soft rosy pink with a slight purple pink shading. 

I placed City museum gray with it because it was part of the same haul with the Nagasawa Decimo - Kaigan stone gray. 

Please note my swatches are quite heavy so you can see the colour chromatography, but I feel these inks will look lovely in a broader nib. 

All inks were swatched on Endless recorder TRP with a Kakimori brass dip pen.

1,"Struggling to use my collection... I've been a long-time bullet journaler and always used my collection for that purpose.  

My life has become much more complicated with a new kid, new house, and new business and I have switched to electronic notes and task management.  

The unintended effect of this switch has been a drastic decrease in my fountain pen usage.  To rectify this, I tried Morning Pages for about a month but didn't jive with it.  My fountain pens have been relegated to a few haphazard notes during a weekly club meeting and it makes me sad.  

I am looking for suggestions and advice on how to best get in the habit of using my collection once again.  

Thanks in advance!"

1,"Show some love for Stub nibs Stub nibs are a lot of fun; and great to show ink properties.
I need to slow down my writing a bit and add pressure to get the line variation.
The Conklin/Jowo nib are really good with some flex and swappable in most #6 units.
Waterman Carene Stub is also great, but stiffer due to the inlaid nib, razor sharp horizontal!
 
What‚Äôs is your experience with Stub nibs?"

1,"Pilot 92 dry up update This is an update to my previous post after I realised I couldn‚Äôt edit it. So my brand new Pilot heritage 92 would suddenly run out of ink mid-sentence. I got a lot of good advice here, to clean the pen thoroughly, and to do the three-drop venting process (with the nib pointing up in approximately a 10 o‚Äôclock position as suggested by my retailer). The first time I tried these procedures it didn‚Äôt work, at least not for long; however I finally gave it a serious rinsing with warm water, then I filled the reservoir with warm water and a little dish soap and let it marinate for twenty minutes or so. Then, after rinsing it again multiple times, it seems to work fine, knock on wood. I‚Äôve written like four-five pages of nonsense while listening to scary stories on YouTube, and it hasn‚Äôt shown any sign of drying up‚Ä¶ my hand is tired though so further stress testing will have to wait till later üòä"

I restored it by replacing the ink sac, cleaning/buffing, replacing the mangled nib, and highlight the brand logo. These are great pens and write wonderfully! The Venus (a division of Esterbrook) nib assemblies are a direct fit. The Venus broad is such a smooth nib, and is rather ""stub-like."" The beautiful ""mackeral"" pattern in the celluloid came to life after a good hand-buffing with a Sunshine Cloth! You just can't beat a good J fountain pen!

1,"NPD with an Asvine p20 Continuing to enjoy Asvine products. 

While most Chinese pens I've purchased have been hit or miss (looking at you Jinhao), all the pens I've purchased so far from Asvine have been great!

I like the build of this, I like the nib (medium), I like the weight, it's smooth enough, nice and wet and of course you can't beat the price. 

If I didn't know better I would think this is $100 pen. 

I have an Asvine p50 coming today, we will see if it continues the trend or if I finally get a dud."
1,"Current Rotation I think I finally found a rotation I like. From bottom to top: Jinhao 82 with Parker Blue Black, Jinhao x850 with Diamine Green/Black, Jinhao x350 with Jinhao Black, Jinhao 100 with Diamine Oxblood.  

The 82 is my work pen. It's perfect as a work pen because it is small, light and inexpensive. It fits in my pocket perfectly, plus if it breaks/gets lost I can either fix it or replace it with the other 82s I already have.  It gets either blue or black ink only.

The x850.  It is heavy, good looking and it writes beautifully with an extra fine nib.  One of my favorites.  If I really like an ink I will put it in this pen.  

The x350 I had as my everyday pen for a couple months straight.  It was a great workhorse.  Never leaked, never complained and always worked.  This pen is my 'black ink only' pen.  When I am not at work it is in my pocket.

The Jinhao 100. The Parker Duofold is one of my grail pens. Eventually I will get one but, for my current budget, the 100 is a great substitute.  It writes buttery smooth and the ink seems to last forever.  If i have to do alot of writing this is the pen I will use.  Most of the time it is inked with colored ink so I get to let my creative side out.  I usually put any new colors in this pen first. 

It only took me 2 years of buying and trying different pens to get this team recruited.  The collection won't go to waste though.  I will be going through the collection to see what pens do work and using those with my karkos inks for coloring/drawing.

Now.... to stop buying pens...."
1,"NPD: Jinhao 9013 I like my Jinhao 9019s a lot. I have four of them and enjoy writing with their #8 nibs.

My 9016s are the smaller 9019s. At least in terms of looks and the intentions but both #6 nibs I have are really so so. I replaced one with Kaigelu and planning to replace the other with a Goulet nib. 

Then there is the smallest of my 90xx family, the 9013. If the 9016 is still big for your liking, then you may like the 9013. It has the same nib size as the 9016 but for some reason I prefer the nib of my 9013. It reminded me of my Platinum #3776 writing experience. Kind of but not quite.

I still think the #6 nibs of Jinhao are not as good as the #8 nibs. I hope that Jinhao can improve their #6 nibs as not everybody likes the supersized pens.

Some of my thoughts are written in one of the photos. Have a nice weekend ahead."

1,"Back in the game Hello fellow redditors,

I am back in the fountain pen game and want to share my experiences and concerns.  
(Pardon my English, I am not a native speaker)

In Germany we had to learn cursive in Elementary school with a fountain pen, the Lamy ABC was mandatory these days. Due to the fact that my mother was into handwriting and also a bit calligraphy, I was super exited to get my very own fountain pen after writing with pencils and even on small blackboards pupils had to carry around (the 90s were a crazy time ...). So I got my Lamy ABC and it even got my Name engraved! I really enjoyed learning how to use the fountain pen.

But my handwriting was pretty bad. Don't get me wrong: I was never the kid whose teachers couldn't read the handwriting, but I did not like the way my handwriting looked.

Well, I improved it and I was one of the boys (nowadays I do not identify as any social gender, so I would love if you do not use ""he"" or ""him"", thank you!) with pretty good readable handwriting. 

But times had changed and so my writing device did. In the third grade I got one of these mirthful Online Ballpoint pens. My handwriting became truly ugly (but still readable). Some years later I used the Lamy Safari. My handwriting changed once again. It was a time where I tried to find my own style and I experimented a lot. Some of those handwriting s were good, some were a pain in the arse.
Then I found and fell in love with the Parker Jotter, my absolute favourite roller all pen ever (I own a freaking lot of them, some are special editions). I pretty much like the way my handwriting looks with the Jotter, I would say, it is the best handwriting I am able to produce. But it wasn't a fountain pen, the device I admire so much.

So I decided to buy a good fp. I went to the local stationary shop and tried a lot of pen. From Lamy to Faber Castillo and Pelikan. I also tried the Jotter Pen, but it was just okay, too light and too slim. I ended up with a Waterman Hemisphere. It suited me really well. My handwriting improved once again.

Then I went to university. A freaking lot of handwriting, so I thought it would be once again time for the Jotters to have a comeback.

Now, 12 years of rollerball-writing, I decided that it is time to get a new fountain pen. So I ordered a  Leonardo Officina Italiana Momento Zero Sorrento Blue &amp; Gold at Stilo e Stile. I opted for the broad nib, because it looked pretty medium on the writing examples. Well, it is broader than I thought. But maybe I'll get used to it.

I tried the new fp and I really like it. But hell, my arm and my hand hurt so much after writing some pages. Past 12 years the freaking rollerballs ruined my handwriting as well as all of my muscle memory. It is like I have to learn who to write with the fountain pen a second time. My handwriting looks awfull.

I will take the chance to improve my handwriting once again. It will be hard work, but at least, I am back in the game!"

1,"Haunted by first pen show experience Last year when I attended my first pen show I was still very new in my fountain pen experience.  I spend lot of times browsing and touching and asking many questions but did not buy much.  I got one  pen, two inks and a few notebooks.  Of course later I come on this sub and YT and find out that many bought way, way more than I did. One vender actually said to me ""please buy something."" in a very nice funny way.  I have felt bad since and vow to save more and spend more this year to support the vendors at the show.

This morning I dreamt that I was back at the show and found the all the vendors who were very kind to me even though I didn't buy anything from them.  Now I can't stop thinking about it.  

This year I gave myself a set amount I want to spend on pens, inks and paper.  The trouble is I'm going to visit Hong Kong and Tokyo this summer before the pen show in September. I have already planned out stores I want to visit and pens I want to check out...and wonder if I will have money left for the pen show.

1,"Planning Work Project with cursive practice Hey all,

Today I got to use dotted paper for planning a work project and it‚Äôs pretty sweet! Granted I just used a crappy printer paper with a printed pattern, it turned out well I think. I‚Äôve been working on my cursive and it‚Äôs by no means good but I can write fluently in it, something I haven‚Äôt done since elementary school. 

This was done using a WingSing 601 inked with Pilot Iroshizuku Kon-Peki. The pen is nice but I find that it has a sweet spot and I don‚Äôt really like that. If the pen rotates any, your line thins up. Then there is the problem with the paper. This ink and pen combo is bleeding making finer lines harder. I would reverse write the nib but it‚Äôs too scratchy to want to do for long. 

What do you all think of dotted paper? I‚Äôm thinking of trying it for journaling and practice cursive writing. Also, anyone use a WingSung 601? Do you like it? And finally, what‚Äôs your experience with nibs having a sweet spot? I haven‚Äôt had the problem too much."

I'm currently loving one of the designs currently on the Shibui North website for their titanium Pocket Fox pen and am thinking of getting it for myself to commemorate a milestone I just hit. But this would be my most expensive pen. It's well within my budget but I'm a bit nervous about buying something at that price without trying it first.  I'm wondering if people can talk to their experience with the Pocket Fox, maybe compare it in terms of things like size/weight/writing comfort to other pens?  What about cap seal and durability and ease of cleaning?

I've been experimenting with a variety of more beginner pens from different brands and right now my favorites to use are probably my TWSBI ECO-T, Lamy Al Star, Pilot Kakuno, &amp; Hongdian Forest &amp; 8041. My smallest pens (probably closest in comparison to the Fox) are a Pilot Prera, Jinhao 82, some old Sheaffer school pens, and Hongdian M2. I've also tried a Kaweco Sport at a store.

I did a quick search of the sub but most of the Shibui posts I've seen have been celebrating a new pen - so I'm wondering about the experience after some use.  Thanks!"

1,Ap world notes r actually becoming fun with fountain pens  
1,"**Pro tip: Add items to your cart and leave** For more reasons than one, waiting to purchase your cart can be beneficial. For starters, it gives you time to think the purchase over, (maybe you need to consider finances or whether it‚Äôs something you really want or sort of need.) 
The **best** reason though is that many online stores will recognize your email address (signing up for ‚Äúnews and promos‚Äù emails may be a requirement) and when you‚Äôve got a cart full of merchandise, they can smell a sale is close at hand. Many Many shops will end up sending you a coupon to entice you to hurry up and make that purchase! This is common practice with many online retailers but I find it is especially true with the niche hobbies, of which I participate in several. 
I‚Äôll end the post by saying again that you NEVER want to pay msrp for ANYTHING. Everything can be had at a discount. If not a sale, a coupon will come at some point. The exception being LEs, those go fast and you may not have a choice but to pay msrp. In that case, check shops on both sides of the Atlantic/pacific as the Japanese releases are often spectacular in comparison to their US counterparts (better &amp; more packaging, freebies etc. Only my experience, ymmv) and can be had at prices much lower than your local shops.

1,"Unpopular opinion: Buying second-hand instead of new should be encouraged more I say this because often a good second-hand pen can be bought for less than what you would pay for a new pen and thus can have things you wouldn't be able to get in a comperatively priced new pen such as a converter, gold nib etc. As an example, I have obtained a Sheaffer Imperial for cheap (the price escapes me however I remember that it was way below the street price of an Eco.) These pens are also great practice for fixing pens, tuning nibs etc. and ,as evidenced by the Right To Repair campaign, such self sustainment is needed. Another thing is that I think buying new pens are straining our planet because in order to produce a new fountain finite materials such as steel, gold have to be mined. With a second-hand pen such concerns aren't needed. I also like having pens with history behind them. I think they are more exciting that way. I have several pens engraved with a company or person name and I even have one of them in my pencil case. To finish, I recommend everyone to visit their local flea market once in a while"

1,"The Pilot Collection It didn‚Äôt take me very long after I started in the fountain pen world to declare that Pilot was the brand for me. Since then I‚Äôve put together a decent collection of the pens. Some are very common and a couple others are a little less so.

1st Picture: Kakuno, MR, Super 200, Burberrys, U, Deluxe

2nd Picture: Kakuno, Prera, Namiki Falcon, Decimo, Custom 74, Custom 823

The Burberrys pen is probably the most interesting. It looks like Pilot manufactured pens for them at some point in the past. The body and nib of the pen is very reminiscent of the deluxe and it takes Pilot cartridges. It writes well too."
1,"Wing Sung 632: ebonite piston-filler, 18K nib I don‚Äôt know much more than you see here. As usual, 365Days Stationary Store on AliExpress seems to have the first selection. Multiple colors, choice of white or gold trim and the white trim pieces have a white metal (palladium?) plating on the #8 18K nib. 

Comparing the dimensions to the 600, it‚Äôs a little shorter but the same girth, so I imagine it will present as a somewhat stubby pen, a look I can get with. 

Apparently no heartbeat nibs for this model but the WS ‚Äò1947‚Äô style nib, offered in E/F/M/B and several sizes of long knife tips. 

The price of the 632 is $260 USD for regular nibs; $299 USD for long knife nibs. 

I‚Äôm told Wing Sung is introducing another of these 600 series pens in June with a number #9 nib. I hope it‚Äôs 14K to keep the price reasonable.

I'm looking to buy my first gold nib pen and I wanted to get your suggestions/recs to research. I don't want to go overboard on price, so let's say $200 and under.

What are your thoughts?"
1,"Unpopular Opinion: We should NOT be promoting hyper-consumerism I do not like how our community has this notion of ""down the rabbit hole you go"" with fountain pens, it becomes less an interest and more a cycle of instant gratification.

Also, regularizing spending half your wallet on pens does not help and often jokes with this nature gets taken by less experienced enthusiasts literally.

I hate how some posts say, ""Please don't judge, my collection is very humble"" and they literally have a short collection of pens they like, and they somehow have the notion that it is not enough to fit in with other enthusiasts, or that their pens aren't prestigious enough. Although no one judges a humble collection, just the fact that they feel shy about it is bad.

Also, must you spend a hundred more dollars on a pen that is the same thing? Like why are you buying another pro gear when your pro gear will be practicing the same except the thickness of some line.

I think this community had begun to -although no completely- the idea that your fountain pens should be treasured, and that this is an expensive ass hobby.

To all of you who aren't wealthy but buy prestigious pens, please, just invest that money into gaining more wealth, best case scenario you get more money for pens (or for more money), worst case scenario you lose most of your money and learn something and had done something productive and character building.

Test yourself right now with this theoretical:
You have a humble collection of 1 beginner pen, 3-5 next level pens and 1 entry gold nib pen. You have the option to buy a $350 worth pen (think a limited edition sailor pro gear or a pilot 823) for $180 new, but on the other hand you discover a $200 worth pen (think a pilot 742 or a beautiful pro gear slim) for $50.

The former is your Grail pen, whilst the latter is like a direct downgrade but almost same to your Grail pen. You really want this pen and can afford it, although it took you a few months to save up the money. You know you should really just buy the latter, but would you?"

Sailor Pro fit Jr MF
 ‚Ä¢ Personally I do not like this pen. I feel it is not a smooth flow of ink. I was kinda sad about this as I was very excited to get my first Sailor pen and it has somewhat turned me away from that brand.

 ‚Ä¢ One of my casual work pens, I often take this pen up in altitude and it is a very smooth write! I have had issues where it gets stuck and turning the cap to release pressure doesn't change it so I've had to take it apart but definitely a nice pen!

Majohn A2 Click out F
 ‚Ä¢ I have had no problems with this pen. It travels well does not leak, always writes lovely and is another conversation starter. Great pen 

Ferris Wheel Press Bijou F 
 ‚Ä¢ My newest addition and a lovely pen, very sturdy, writes smooth, and has a good weight to it. The engraved two tone steel nib is very nice. Much prefer this pen over my other Ferris wheel press pen. 

Kaweco Al Sport EF and F 
 ‚Ä¢ These go with me everywhere. They're perfect and the only issue I had, the company fixed for me and sent the one back. I adore these pens from how they write to they weight in your hand.

Ferris Wheel Press Aluminum Carousel Pen F
 ‚Ä¢ Very pretty pen but not so practical. Does not travel well as it leaks a bit and the converter is not stable in the pen. The nib is actually larger than my other. 

Iro Utsushi Resin F 
 ‚Ä¢ An amazing fine point dip pen for cheap. I love having this readily available for testing inks before filling my other pens 

Dallaiti Birch with Mahogany Finish Quill
 ‚Ä¢ The pen that started my love for calligraphy and fountain pens. A sturdy piece from Italy, I actually have 2 other pens from them, another birch quill and a feather quill.

However, it did not write like my m200 Broad so I never used the nib. It was too thin of a line and felt off when writing. No amount of adjusting it got it to a point where I liked it.

So, since I got a deal on the pen, I decided to buy a new 14k broad nib for the pen itself. I still have the old one to mess with and if I get it in a good spot eventually (or have it tuned), I'll toss it into my m200.

I took a picture of both nibs side by side. Old nib on the left and the new one on the right. You can clearly see they both said B nibs, but the points are vastly different. (Bad) writing sample in the second image showing the line differences.

The new nib writes like my m200 broad. It's lovely. Just thought I'd share some photos of the differences."

14K is a little feedbacky but i dont say it is scratchy, like writing with a pencil.(M)

I tried pens with ink dipped not actually filled the pen.Lecturum papers that i have used in store.

ƒ∞ got the 14k beacause of the price.

When i got home, filled the pen with waterman ink.Tried in rhodia paper.ƒ∞t is really scratchy pen , i cant not say it is feedback.

So , what should i do right now ?I search a little 21k and 14k is not so different at all in terms of writing experince, but for me i really find a lot difference.This is normal ,or my 14k nib can be defective ?

1,"Planning for a broad nib I've been trying to find a pen with a broad nib to buy in Brazil. I mostly buy pens from Shopee or Aliexpress, so I'm a bit restricted to Chinese pens and the lower end Platinum and Pilot pens, all of which only go up to medium nibs, or stubs (and I mostly dislike stubs.)

So far, I've only been able to find Lamy Safari or Kawecos Sport with broad nibs, on Amazon. They're mostly the same price, very expensive for me, but doable with some saving. I love the colors I could find for the Kawecos Sport, and I'm ok with the colors I found for the Safaris, but I don't love them. 

What keeps me from going for a Kaweco is that I have a Perkeo, and an Al Sport, and both are very dry. 
I love the Perkeo medium nib because it gives me some stubby line variance without being too wide, but the Sport nib is just bordering on uncomfortable unless I use the wettest inks.

I'm looking for a broad nib because I'm trying to make my ink sheen, so I'm assuming I need the nib to be wet. I can see sheen on Optik paper if I write in slow motion with a Lamy medium nib. Would a Kaweco broad nib also be too dry for that, and should I go with Lamy?"

1,"Water visible in your Sailor‚Äôs section is not normal! &amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vgqen4bf9kwc1.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=611c85e2a2ddfc31789903a5381c275065f65e63

I‚Äôve noticed that this question comes up a lot:

**There's water inside the section of my transparent/translucent Sailor pen. Is this normal?**

I‚Äôve also seen a lot of people respond that it‚Äôs perfectly normal in a perfectly well intentioned effort to alleviate their worries.

Unfortunately though, it's not normal.

Those that insist that seeing water in there is normal have probably made that assumption going by their knowledge of how many other pens are constructed. Many pens have feeds that are fitted directly into the section, or fitted into a transparent or translucent nib housing that would allow ink to be seen through it when fitted into a transparent section.

Most Sailors however, are not built that way.

Here‚Äôs my Sailor Pro Gear Slim. While it's smaller than most of the Sailor‚Äôs line, the way it's constructed is identical to its bigger siblings. It also happens to be transparent which will make things easier to see.

&amp;#x200B;

[Whole pen. Nice transparent color.](https://preview.redd.it/rgaydmfi9kwc1.png?width=1201&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fabfb38f65e894801ce54143e5631d169cd83f4a)

&amp;#x200B;

[Here it is with its section removed. ](https://preview.redd.it/4odusbygekwc1.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5bbcf27bd192c9c385cae6ddcc4d0401d8f22c25)

Take note of the parts:

1. Nib
2. Nib Housing - The nib housing is partially visible through the section. It‚Äôs the black portion, and I've never seen it in any other color than opaque black.
3. Grip - This is the outer part of the section that you hold when you write with the pen.
4. Trim Ring
5. Threaded Sleeve - This threaded sleeve screws into the barrel, but also screws onto the nib housing. It has an o-ring that mates with the barrel to provide some friction to prevent inadvertantly unscrewing it from the barrel.
6. Converter

&amp;#x200B;

[Here‚Äôs the section close up with the converter pulled out. ](https://preview.redd.it/fku6nv2n9kwc1.png?width=1201&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=10d246a2a536720e0f17547d2a69e02c10aa39a5)

&amp;#x200B;

[Now the section disassembled, and the parts numbered accordingly.](https://preview.redd.it/g530417r9kwc1.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=530f47e63101e6af2eccfeead8812adf4d2a9ffc)

&amp;#x200B;

[Here‚Äôs what it looks like with just the nib housing \(2\) and threaded sleeve \(5\) are screwed together without the grip \(3\)](https://preview.redd.it/sb9mbotw9kwc1.png?width=1201&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=739f8bb3d1ffef760082a50abd7245f88a2eef8e)

&amp;#x200B;

[And here‚Äôs how the converter \(6\) attaches to the nib housing \(2\). As you can see, the converter creates a seal directly with the nipple on the nib housing. As a result, in normal use, ink will never come in contact with the threaded sleeve \(5\) or the inside of the grip \(3\).](https://preview.redd.it/e08ugf60akwc1.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb94f22a127b32dc781572770abd6b59f9126979)

&amp;#x200B;

[Finally, a sectional view of the entire section.](https://preview.redd.it/5iy836t3akwc1.png?width=3900&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3695806c18709ef6fba0abeeea4381b34fac4c17)

&amp;#x200B;

So, when the pen is being used, the only time ink should come in contact with the grip (3) is when filling the pen from a bottle (ignoring cases of ink residue that might transfer from the inside of the cap). However, because of the o-ring between the nib housing (2) and the grip (3), ink should not be entering the interior of the grip simply by dipping the nib and part of the section in ink to fill.

&amp;#x200B;

**So why are people so frequently seeing water trapped on the inside of the grip?**

This almost always happens when the user does one of two things:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hpho3sc9akwc1.png?width=3900&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=de7a45ff90d811edd367cddc5f3a72d9c8ffd1c8

First is when they try to force water in through the back of the section assembly through the threaded sleeve to try and flush the pen.

* Typically the user [fits a bulb syringe onto the metal threaded sleeve](https://new.reddit.com/r/fountainpens/comments/wy113w/sailor_pgs_leaking_section/) (5) instead of coupling the bulb directly into the nib housing‚Äôs nipple. Doing this does push water through the nib housing and through the feed to flush ink out, but it also risks sending water between the nib housing (2) and threaded sleeve (5) and into the interior of the grip (3).
* The fact that this can happen is because there is no sealant or o-ring between the nib housing and the threaded sleeve, and the thread tolerances are not tight enough to prevent water from seeping through.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3wamgvsbakwc1.png?width=1201&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bad54169ef430af18eb4e5fe4be7bdb37547c4fc

Second is when the user soaks the entire section in water, especially in an ultrasonic bath.

* In this case, there is more than one way for the water to get inside the grip. It can seep in through the same path as above, but it can also seep in between the edge of the grip (3) and the trim ring (4) because there is also no sealant or o-ring between those parts.

&amp;#x200B;

**So how do you flush a sailor pen without getting water trapped inside the section?**

There are basically two options. One is to purchase [Sailor‚Äôs pen cleaning kit](https://en.sailor.co.jp/product/14-1006/) which comes with a syringe and an attachment that fits directly onto the nib housing nipple. However if that‚Äôs too expensive, the other best option is to cut the closed end off a sailor cartridge and fit your bulb syringe onto the cartridge rather than directly onto the threaded metal sleeve.

[When a cartridge\/converter is attached, water only goes through the housing. ](https://preview.redd.it/ffkwqrcfakwc1.png?width=3900&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=323ff0daee5dd4fa5a2c7c866f5717ba1f305260)

&amp;#x200B;

**On the other hand...**

I have seen a few situations where ink begins to seep into the same area and the user says they have not tried to flush the pen and only used a cartridge or a converter in the normal way. Going by the way the pen is designed, its evident that this is not supposed to happen, but what has caused it to do so I'm not entirely sure. My hypotheses on this include:

* A faulty converter/cartridge lip that allows the ink to go where it's not supposed to
* A faulty housing nipple that might not be creating a proper seal with the cartridge/converter
* User might not be seating the cartridge snugly

&amp;#x200B;

**And of course, so what?**

This is certainly primarily a cosmetic problem, and for the most part only really an issue for for pens that have transparent or translucent sections. However, it's probably worth it to keep in mind that constant moisture in that area of the pen does create a bit of an opportunity for the metal threaded sleeve to corrode, especially if it‚Äôs ink rather than water that got trapped in there. Also, sometimes the ink/water can [seep out entirely](https://new.reddit.com/r/fountainpens/comments/yvk8fi/ink_leaking_through_the_section_in_a_weird_spot/) where it can stain your fingers.

I'm also not going to go into how to remove the water beyond what you might be able to extrapolate from the photos and explanation above. This is mostly because disassembling the section the way I did for this demonstration is always a risk, and would most likely void the warranty. Repeatedly disassembling it could wear out parts and over-tightening the assembly is likely to cause cracks. My intent was primarily to provide the information so that owners can simply avoid the problem to begin with.

Oh and lastly, the Sailor Compass and possibly one or two other models are an exception to this entire spiel. :)"
1,"You are all enablers I bought my first fountain a little over a week ago because Reddit suggested this sub to me. Immediately fell in love. Then I made the ‚Äúmistake‚Äù of subscribing to this sub and reading posts, watching lots of YouTube videos and researching and researching. All while taking notes with my LAMY AL-star.

I bought and received a ‚Äúpaper sample‚Äù packet (of like 30 different paper types!) a few days ago to figure out which paper to swap to for my ideal fountain pen writing experience.

I now have 3 new (to me) pens on the way from various places. And am deep in the rabbit hole of researching inks to try‚Ä¶ wanting to try some sheening inks that work well with finer nibs.

I‚Äôve been an avid physical paper planning, task tracker and note taker for years and while I did find a couple of writing utensils that worked well for me there was always something missing. Now thanks to all of you I‚Äôve found it!

Thank you!"
1,"A week in Finally decided to jump in the fountain pen pool with a Lamy Safari. My dealer, I mean store I get my notebooks from, happened to have some special edition Safari for 35% off so I stopped by only to find out it‚Äôs only online.  My dealer, correction: the store employee, talked me into dropping change to try out the Platinum Preppy. Went home and pulled out my new TN regular and ended up writing for hours. So I hopped on their website and ordered the Safari. 

This evening I went to pick it up and grabbed some black ink cartridges for both the PP and Safari. As soon as I got home I just plopped in the cartridge and stared to write. At that moment I realized two things. 

1. I didn‚Äôt realize I had purple ink which was way too light for my tastes. 

2. Lamy‚Äôs concept of a fine nib and Platinum Preppy‚Äôs (which I prefer) aren‚Äôt the same. 

So now I have to go to my dealer again to get an extra fine nib. I‚Äôll suffer through the purple ink if the nib is fine enough but otherwise I really like the Safari.  


I will not buy more stuff whilst there.  
I will not buy more stuff whilst there. 
I will NOT buy more stuff whilst there. 

Maybe a converter and some really dark black ink won‚Äôt hurt. I saw a guy who filled the entire PP and why not experiment with a $3 pen?  Maybe I should buy one more to experiment on. TWSBI‚Äôs look promising..

1,"Sharing and Looking for recommendations! Please share your experience. Hi everyone!  I am relatively new to fountain pens. I am looking for some recommendations for some pens to look into for something a bit more towards my exact preference.  Here is my current collection in order and what I love about them and what I don't. 

Diplomat magnum EF - I love the bounce this nib has.  The size of the pen and the weight are both a bit small and light for my preference though.  If I  have a long writing session my hand cramps up. 

Pilot Metropolitan F - I love the nib. It's a bit scratchy, but that doesn't bother me. My only complaint is the step down.  It just isn't the most comfortable to hold. 

Parker 21- it just doesn't hold enough ink.  It's a vintage model that performs like a boss. This is my desk pen, so I can't really travel with it either due to the plastic being fragile. 

Conklin All American titanium omniflex-  I love the body of this pen unposted.  It feels great during long writing sessions because of the body and the weight. The nib is just not for me.  It feels so stiff trying to get any flex, I would say this is even stiffer than my magnum.  

Conklin duragraph F- it's an awesome pen that is just a bit skinny for my liking.  The nib is great, very smooth with just a bit of feedback. 

Lamy Safari F-  I like this pen a lot.  It's an awesome pen for an edc.  It feels great, but it writes thicker than my other fines. 

Monteverde Innova Stub- I love this pen.  The nib is smooth but it just doesn't suit my handwriting very well.  It's a number 6 jowo nib. 

Monteverde one touch stub-  this is a cool pen. My only complaint is that it only takes an international short cartridge.  It's a number 5 nib.  It suits my small handwriting much better than my other stub and its just as smooth.  I use this as my work pen. 

Thank you so much for reading and listening.  I appropriate all feedback and advice, because I need it.  I hope that you have a great day/night or whatever floats your boat.   "

1,"Jinhao 80 with a Lamy Nib I thought I would like the pen, I never imagined that I would absolutely love the pen. 

A few days ago I changed the nib on my Safari with an M nib. So, I had an F nib lying around. Recently I went to a pen show where I tried a Jinhao 80 and instantly loved how the pen feels at hand and purchased one. But those only come with fine nibs that are a lot finer than this one that I have. 

So, to give my Lamy nib a new home and in an attempt to enjoy this beautiful instrument, I ordered anothe Jinhao 80, this time with black trim, and put the Lamy nib in it and I feel in love instantly. 
The wet nib, comfortable grip, great balance, matte texture, everything just speaks to me. The pen is comfortable for longer writing sessions. I might just make this my edc at the office. 

Now that raises the question, what does actually matter, the nib or the body?"

* Simply for the fun of it, as an escape, or to be silly 
* To de-stress, stay grounded, maintain mental health, clear the mind
* To connect with others ‚Äî kids, family, friends, pen pals
* As a creative outlet: stories, poetry, illustration, doodles, calligraphy
* To learn or improve handwriting and cursive
* To record life, feelings, observations, challenges
* To make boring work or school a little more enjoyable 
* Simple note-taking, lists, basic tasks at home or at work
* To reinforce learning
* To get away from devices, screens, and all this insane technology 
* Brainstorming, exploring ideas, inventing
* Explore, enjoy, learn about the fountain pen hobby
* ***Not sure ‚Äòwhy‚Äô ‚Äî it‚Äôs just happening***

I live in Boston, so I used to just go to Appelboom and pay about $40 to get any pen fixed and not have to think about it twice. Unfortunately, that location recently closed and I have two expensive pens I need to repaired. People have given me great  US based nibmeister suggestions such as Kirk Speer who charge about the same price for repairs. However, the big problem is that shipping rates for any insurance package containing expensive pens is absolutely eye watering (like more than $100+).

Should I return it? The authorized lamy distributor has accepted to  send it so they can check. I have also took some pictures of the nib under a loupe so maybe you can have a look and tell me if he was right or just the way the pen is? Also how can I remove ink stain from lamy standard black ink of the makrolon body?"

I like to use a slightly different ink to everyone else, as much as I can get away with without looking pretentious or breaking the policy. 
Specifically, the ink HAS to be dark, but I don't want black. I've been using Diamine blue/black registrars ink and getting away with that no problem. So want something maybe just slightly bluer (still very dark), with a some shading and warm sheen. (No shimmer). Open to other colour suggestions too if still very dark but with shading and sheen.

I'm using Lamy Al-star F and a Fabio castel Hexo M

1,"I bought more ink than I have pens. Help? Hello all you lovely people. I too was directed to this sub about a month ago from somewhere else on Reddit, and I immediately wanted to be one of you. Of course I did. I bought a FP about ten years ago (a Parker, don‚Äôt judge) because I felt that it improved the quality of my writing (both ways), and it felt like a bit of a naughty treat. I haven‚Äôt used it in a while, because life, so I thought I had better get a new one. So, I bought an orange Kaweco sporty translucent one (not the fancy ones, it cost about ¬£17), and a converter, and some orange ink, and then I began my mental health journal, and it really does help with one‚Äôs writing (both ways). Then I needed a pencil case, so that I could keep everything tidy and out of everyone else‚Äôs sight. And then, I thought, maybe I‚Äôll get some more ink. There‚Äôs no harm in some more ink. But the ink was 5 for 4, so I had to have 5 bottles of Diamine because I felt I was missing out if I didn‚Äôt have any of that, and it‚Äôs so pretty‚Ä¶ and I picked up a bronze Lamy (just a ¬£20 one) as well, and a converter, and some Clairefontaine notebooks, because postage is free if you spend ¬£40, so it would be rude not to. 

So. Here we are. I have 2 FPs, and 6 bottles of ink. And that doesn‚Äôt seem to work out, mathematically.

It seems I need 4 more pens. 

I like the weight of my Lamy more than the lightness of the Kaweco (which I don‚Äôt dislike), and it has a broad nib this time, which I like better because I‚Äôve realised I like my pen/ink to be wet. All this stuff I‚Äôm learning! So if, hypothetically, I was to consider another pen, at a budget level still, sadly, what should I go for next? Is an extra broad nib too mad? Which is the best shimmery ink to get as a beginner? Why would I need a syringe? So many questions.

I've got 2 pens that utilize a cap that screws on / off. Both of them will dry out if I don't use them frequently. From that ive seen online you should be able to leave them for more than 3 days. (Which seems to be my threshold for them drying out) 

(Drying out as in it takes me 10-20 seconds to get them going, not have to wash them with soap.) 

(When eirth are my pen of the day, they will write wonderfully all day, consistently) 

Questions from the top of my head:
1) how much pressure/torque should I be using when capping?

2) they sound a little squeaky when capping. Is there a grease or something I'm supposed to have on there to make a better seal?

1,"Faber Castell Ambition I just want to talk about it! I never see anyone else with this pen. It‚Äôs become my go-to work pen that can commute on the train and go in my bag. 

Pros are a pleasantly springy steel nib that handles crummy office paper like a champ. Cap is like an airlock (good and bad - never hard starts but can take some muscle to uncap). 

It has a couple of design flaws - the nib unit will loosen on me and need a half turn to tighten after a long writing session or if I‚Äôm frequently capping and uncapping it. Disposable cartridges can get stuck up in the barrel. 

I am of two minds about the textured resin barrel - it‚Äôs pleasant to touch and keeps the pen light, but it can have a slightly chintzy look and feel next to the solid, shiny stainless elements.

The balance is right for me, and the step down doesn‚Äôt interfere with my grip. It guzzles ink - but I‚Äôve got so darn much ink to get through.

That‚Äôs all! It‚Äôs just an underrated pen at a weird price point that I wanted to discuss. Thanks for letting me share!"
1,"Went down the rabbit hole So... I went a bit overboard with my newfound love of Sailors. I initially bought the ""Night Cherry Blossom"" (pink) pen from the 'Four Season's Weave' line on Amazon. Was my first Sailor and I became completely infatuated. For being a little under $40, it's a solid, nice little steel nib pen that writes well. I'm a ""matchy"" kind of person, and would like each of my pens to have at minimum the same color line with the pen (i.e. blue pen-blue ink, pink pen-pink ink etc)... So I went ahead and purchased the other three in the set--purple, red, and blue. In a perfect world I would like different pens of different colors available at the same time--pink, red, black, blue, purple, green, orange...(you get the picture) because I like having all the different colors to pick from for day to day use. 

I am having buyer's regret as the pens start to come in and am questioning sending them back. They are all roughly $39 dollar pens, which I know is a steal for a Sailor as pro gear slims easily average over $200. I can afford it, but do I really need it is about where I am with this. Yes, the pens are cheap, but buying four of them still adds up. Mostly, I'm second guessing whether having the rainbow of colors is worth spending all the money for.

To complicate things further, I already own a black Sailor promenade, have purchased a couple of 1911s, and a couple PGS's (mostly here from reddit). I don't plan on parting with any of those anytime soon. Besides all of the Sailors, I also currently have two TWSBIs, and two Lamy Al Stars. Currently I'm already up to about seven currently inked pens--with the four new Sailors from reddit purchases, and the four from Amazon will bring me up to 15 pens. 

I guess what I'm looking for are other's opinions and thoughts of having so many pens just to have the color availability vs having more money in my pocket. Opinions greatly appreciated!

TL;DR-- Should I return the 4 Amazon Sailors or keep them?"

This pen is NOT for fast writing. It trains your little inner Buddha, as forces to write every letter thoroughly and accurately.  
Will be good for training.  
Not very good for sketching (but possible yet).

**Platinum Classic Sepia Black**. It's iron-gall ink, suitable for fountain pen.  
Very nice ink with great shading effect on **every** paper you have. No feathering. No bleeding. Almost no ghosting.  
Please note that test was made on very common paper - spiralbook for students.

Fully dries approx. 30s.  
And yes, it's really water-proof. The paper may be completely wet, but the only issue you'll have - letters will loose sepia color and look more black-blue. But no other damage will be done.

I had heard that the Jinhao X750 was a good pen for shimmering inks. I had been looking into Emerald of Chivor but the idea of clogging my pens instilled in me a hesitance.

I have two questions though - firstly, are ink cartridges universal? Lurking this subreddit, I found people sometimes say ""people come for the fountain pens, but stay for the inks"" which makes me curious. Does that mean I can find a cool ink and expect it to work with my fountain pen? The one I bought came with a single cartridge but by practicing, it seems to deplete pretty quickly.

On the note of practice, any recommendations on how to practice? Is it just writing cursive (I have not written cursive since elementary school) and improving the things I notice are wrong, or should I take a more streamlined approach? Any help appreciated!

1,"Vintage Esterbrook SJ hard starting a bit Picked up a vintage Esterbrook SJ (copper) and have been absolutely loving it. Pen fitted with a new sac locally before purchase. 9550 EF nib. Quickly becoming my favorite pocket pen. I write noticeably better with it, looks beautiful, good pocket size. HOWEVER.. I left it in my pen cup for 1 or 2 days to rotate some other pens in. Grabbed it this morning and it took a good 5-6 small cursive letters on Clairefontaine to write consistent and wet. When the nib was first put in the tines were super tight. We spread them a hair, about .015-.02. Less at the tipping. Is this sort of the nature of the beast with the vintage esties? Or is there something I can do to help it stay wet? Spread the tips more and leave the tines .015-.020? Ink is Robert Oster - Caffe Crema because copper :) "
1,"Smooth Extra Fine Nibs Hey all! If I wanted an extra fine nib that is glass-smooth, what should I be looking at?

And no, I'm not talking about Lamy 2000 Extra Fines that write like a medium or those Pelikans, a ""true"" extra fine nib. Not ""glass-smooth"" is totally fine, as long as it's a smooth extra fine. 

Thanks in advance!"
1,"Most stubborn ink in your collection? For me it‚Äôs Wearingeul Dewy Starlight. It‚Äôs even worse than White Rabbit or FWP Lady Rose, which both I can manage with flow aid and certain pens. This one either sticks to my nib like bubblegum or gushes out uncontrollably with just one drop of my flow aid/distilled water solution (1/10 ratio). I tested other dillution ratios as well, all kinds of pen/nib/paper combos and sadly I can only use it with my kakimori nib. Still either skips or gushes.

One 18ml glass bottle of the ink is only 2.5 USD on average, and it shimmers like crazy with really consistent shimmering throughout the entire paragraph, and all I did was to dip the tip of my Kakuno medium pen into it. I don't live in China and they were able to ship internationally.

I've tested it on normal paper and this translucent paper that they provided, and the shimmer is the same, but works even better on this special paper of theirs.

1,"Diamine Amazing Amethyst in the Exquisite Delmoon Raden pen! ü•∞ Full disclosure: I LOVE PURPLE INKS! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èAnd I can‚Äôt get enough of them. However, I am also aware that a lot of purple inks in my collection end up looking quite similar to each other. So when I ordered the Amazing Amethyst from #Diamine I was expecting a regular purple ink - beautiful but probably not exceptional. 

But boy oh boy, was I proved wrong! üôÉ

The ink is purple, yes, but it‚Äôs also pink, and violet and lavender! It‚Äôs dark at some angles and light at others. It‚Äôs complex and holds within itself a wide palette of colours that you discover on your own, as you write with it. 

I paired the ink with my favourite pen - a Delmoon Raden pen called ‚ÄòLavender‚Äô. This hand turned beauty has a colourful medley of little Raden chips that wink up at you so cheerfully that I have re-christened it ‚ÄòRainbow‚Äôs End‚Äô. Why? Because it really feels like I have found a treasure! üåà 

On all parameters of performance, the pen and ink score very high. Like all Diamine inks, Amazing Amethyst is well behaved. It dries fast, flows nicely, and does not ghost or bleed on paper. The pen is a smooooth operator - comfortable in my hands and lovely to write with, with the very reliable number six Jowo nib. üñãÔ∏è 

In short, the pen and ink got together like house on fire, almost like they were made for each other. I haven‚Äôt quite decided if I want to marry them off right away, but they are courting each other quite ardently!ü•∞ üòä

1,"Determining Your Grail Pen This is probably a dumb question, but I'm going to ask it anyways. How did you determine what your grail pen is? Was it strictly looks, was it partially based on trying less-expensive pens by that maker, recommendations from others?

I do know I do not care for Sailor or Lamy, love my Pilots, I'm not a huge fan of Kaweco, but I've not had the opportunity/funds to try some of the upper tier pens. Thus far, I haven't really fallen in love with any one pen, but I'd welcome your wisdom on selecting a grail pen, even one that will take me several years to afford. 

I use my pens primarily for letter/journal-writing and carding, though I am learning how to sketch and have begun to learn calligraphy with my pens as well, if that helps.

Searching for a good black ink for sketching, I opted for Noodler's X-Feather Black, considering my usual sketchbook paper. However, I noticed it smears even when dry, not unlike charcoal or graphite. I tested it and my only other black fountain pen ink (a sampler of Noodler's Black) on different paper with similar results even a day later. I'm wondering if others have experienced this. Is this a Noodler's thing or does it happen with fountain pen blacks in general? I think I recall experiencing similar effects in middle and high school when using Higgins India with a dip pen."

I recently bought a Scriveiner fountain pen with a Schmidt nib, medium. I absolutely loved the pen when using the ink cartridge that came with it. Everything about the way it felt in the hand I absolutely loved the pen when using the ink cartridge that came with it. Everything about the way it felt in the hand, the weight of the pen, and the quality of the ink flow was perfect. When the cartridge ran out, I just refilled it with a colorverse ink using the included converter. Now it seems too wet and there are dots of ink on the nib. The lines are thicker and it doesn‚Äôt write as smoothly. 

So my questions: Is this normal? Is it the ink or did I refill it incorrectly somehow. I absolutely love the variety of ink colors and would much prefer refilling that way than using cartridges, so any insight or suggestions are welcome!"

Nagasawa Decimo - Kaigan Stone grey

I‚Äôve photographed this differently and I must say it looks pretty good on a darker background. 

Another cheeky new pen day, this is the one and only Nagasawa Decimo in a beautiful taupe grey / brown gradient colour way, and this is based on Pilot capless Decimo range, which is slimmer and lighter compared to their regular capless fountain pen.

1,"Jinhao 9019 My 2nd Jinhao. The 1st was the X450, and so far I am not disappointed. Mainly because they're dirt cheap, but also because they are actually good pens. My main motivation for buying it is curiosity. I decided some time ago after trying an MB that big ppens aren't for me. But the 9019 is cheap enough that I might just give it a try as an EDC. I might change my mind.

The 9019 wasn't perfect out of the package. The tines were misaligned a bit, and I could see that they were also quite tight. I adjusted for the misalignment and left the gap for after I tried writing with it. I then found that it was drier than the X450 so my suspicion was right. I spread the tines a bit by pulling the ""wings"" of the nib with my thumbnail. With my loupe I could see the ink-filled slit at the tip more clearly than before. After that it was properly wet. I thought the nib was smooth enough when it was drier, but this adjustment made it slicker. Writing with it is a pleasure. I hold my pens higher so the #8 nib makes up for the short section. I could get some line variations with it and the ink flows proportionately with the spread of the tines. If the slit was a little bit longer this could easily be a semi-flex.

The 9019 is much lighter than the X450. The build quality isn't inferior but I like the section on the X450 more. The section screws on smoother on the X450. I do wish that both pens have a more robust thread profile. Nice of Jinhao to make a big converter for it. The knob has less play than the one in the X450, but it could vary given how loose their QC is. Would I buy it again? Probably not. Would I buy another Jinhao? Definitely. A third Jinhao is on its way. A walnut 9056. I'll be using these for a while and put my Diplomats on the bench."
1,Platinum 3776 solution   Hey pen friends! I‚Äôm an artist and love the Platinum 3776 &lt;SF&gt; nib. However due to my grip as an artist I tend to hold my pens further back which on lots of fountain pens ends up on the section or the transition to the body. The 3776 (century standard models) has a deep step up and sharper threads than most and becomes uncomfortable over time. Long winded way of explaining why I‚Äôm seeking out a solution but I hear of some people successfully using an FNF feed to make the 3776 nib adaptable to a #6 section and using other pen bodies. Does anyone here have experience with that? Or alternatively are there other bodies for the 3776 with different proportions? Like the celluloid? All and any information is appreciated! I really do love the nib.

Some of my affordable pens are not in the picture though no less appreciated by me. I also have a Lamy Al Star in Matte black and the new Kaweco piston filler in Matt black. 
Received the Namiki Yukari Royale in medium nib yesterday and the pen is all that is described and perhaps more. It is heavy as pens go and writes like a dream. Or what dreams are made of. 
The Custom Pilot 845 Urushi was mistaken by me for its more famous sibling the Custom Urushi with its larger nib. A fine nib i had difficulty getting to grips with initially, i now love the feeling and experience of using it. The fine nib does‚Äôt lay down a generous flow of ink but it has never had any hard starts even after a day of not writing with it. The nib allows for defined and precise handwriting and is smooth with some feedback. 
The Pilot Custom 823 is definitely a desert island pen for me. The almost infinite reservoir of ink it carries as far as most fountain pens go with an admirable balance when held creates a satisfying and superior writing experience. 
My first fountain pen was the Montblanc 149 and subsequently the Le Grand special edition. I love them too though i have possibly decided on Pilot as my mainstay. 
I have 2 Custom Urushi‚Äôs on order; with the disruption in Wajima prefecture due to an earthquake it will be some time before i get them. 
Though it seems i have achieved my exit plan as far as Fountain pens go.

But this plunger converter is really demanding, tapping or shaking won't do, I have to unscrew the barrel and fiddle with the plunger rod for the ink to pass through.

I own a croc leather LV Cargo Piston filler fountain pen, there are also versions which use a cartridge or a converter, I am struggling to find maintenance instructions as for example the back end normally is used to empty the pen (by unscrewing) and refill when screwing the back down again when you unscrew the cap completely you are left with just a plastic bit sticking out.

The first ink I used in this Sailor Pro Gear Slim was a cartridge (Sailor Waka-Uguisu) and everything was normal. When I finished the cartridge, I used a converter to pull in Pilot Ajisai ink straight from the bottle. When I did, the grip interior got dark in a sort of triangular pattern like in Picture 1, although over time it shrunk by itself into a tiny oval like in Picture 2. The writing experience remained unaffected, however. 

When I finished the ink, I used the converter to clean the pen with water and the triangular splotch returned. Afterwards I even used a syringe and an open-ended cartridge to clean it just in case, but nothing changed. Picture 1 is how it looked as I cleaned it with water, and Picture 2 is how it looked after I let the pen air dry. 

The writing experience isn't hampered at all by this. After cleaning the pen I've syringe-filled the converter with another ink and it writes the same as before, even if the oval is still there. But I am curious to understand what causes this and if perhaps that oval can ever be ""cleaned."""

The most confusing thing to me is the dripping happens when the pen doesnt write. At random points it just completely stops writing, and then i know if i turn it facing down it will 100% leak. When it does write it writes exremely well as i expected but also never leaks. 
The ink i put in it is Colorverse Butterfly Nebula which is a shimmer ink so not sure if Eco just dislikes shimmer inks. I also filled it just once up to about 80% so there is some air there. Ill test it with a normal ink later when I get home

I really hope this is fixable and just my mistake or maybe smth needing grease cuz the pen did come with silicon grease but i assumed thats to add later when disassembling and cleaning. I really wanted a demonstrator as my daily carry and dont wanna be disappointed and having to refund stuff lol

1,"Fountain pen suitability for FWP Shimmer inks Hey folks, I recently picked up some of the Ferris Wheel Press Shimmer inks (Tumultuous Tides, Bumbling Blossom, and Queen Allium) but was told at the art store originally that they shouldn't really be used in fountain pens because the shimmer ink will cause clogging and issues with the pens. Said art store also doesn't have a lot of fountain pen experience so I wasn't certain about that and with them being quite pretty, I didn't want to just take that answer as the be-all, end-all haha. 

A quick google search suggested that this was not the case, that you could use the shimmers in fountain pens, but to go with a medium nib to help things out? I was thinking about picking up one of the Ferris Wheel Press Carousel pens; would that be suitable for use with the FWP Shimmer inks? 

I currently have a MontBlanc invincia with the fine nib, 2 faber castell hexos with fine nibs, and a platinum preppy with a fine nib. Does anyone happen to know if it'd work in those either? The FWP Carousels aren't too expensive so I had planned to just pick one of those up anyways rather than toss it in one of my existing pens. I wanted to double check though that the FWP carousel pens would actually work with the shimmer ink, so if anyone has experience, I'd love to hear about it!

I also wouldn't be opposed to picking up a Kaweco Perkeo or a Lamy Safari if either of those would be more suitable, since they're still on the cheaper end of things and I can find them locally.

&amp;#x200B;

I was into FP's 15-13 years ago, and at the time bought a couple Noodler's 'flex' pens when they came out, had a Mottishaw Spencerian approx. Falcon, and a couple vintage 14k pens.

I have been out of the FP world for a while, and now I am catching up on so many of the options out there.

I lost my Mottishaw Falcon, and am sad =(  but ordered a Pilot 912 and plan to have Mikeitwork turn it into Spencerian. I also bought a Moonman C2, it's on its way.

Would you all mind catching me up on the below? I've done several hours of searching and reading but it is wild how many pages and posts are out there on the internet but without a ton of clarity:

1. TWSBI Eco - I know the company has been around a while but I never had gotten into them. Is the Eco basically a stub? And is it a good deal for the $35 it runs on Amazon?
2. FPR - is their primary draw, their modern flex nibs? And what is considered the best pen to swap an FPR flex nib into?
3. Jinhao - seems like they have a lot of love. What are some of their best pens to try? And do they run the gamut of flex, and italic?

In terms of what I'm after: I'd like a sharp, and a cursive, Italics for ""calligraphy"", I'd like a couple flex options. That's primarily it.

&amp;#x200B;

I have an Eversharp Symphony, and Skyline, I'm thinking to get cleaned up too. But if I understand correctly, it's not a good idea to mod or regrind these old 14k nibs, is that right?

All I can think to add is that neither of them smell like a Sailor ink or a KWZ ink. I added an Ancient Copper scribble at the bottom to help calibrate your sense of how colours come across on my camera with a widely known ink.

1,"Pressure? Just got into fountain pens. Bought a pilot E95S recently and I‚Äôve been using it with some Taccia black ink. I read a few posts on this subreddit about writing pressure that kinda confused me. It seems like the general consensus is that you should be applying zero pressure to an FP while writing, but my handwriting is completely illegible if I attempt to do that, leaving me with no option but to write with as much pressure as a regular ballpoint pen (and, I have a tendency to grip REALLY hard when I write with one). I‚Äôm worried I might be damaging the tines because sometimes the pen scrapes a little bit while writing with pressure. Any advice on how I can correct this habit? "

Jinhao 9036 EF in Ebony.
Jinhao 9056 EF in Rosewood.  

Both are beautiful looking pens.  The 9036 is very similar to the X850 which is my favorite pen.  The 9056 is almost the size of the X159.  I have the 9036 inked in Parker Blue Black and it is going to be my daily for the next while.  The 9056 will be given its chance eventually as it is just to good looking to be in permanent storage, I am just not a fan of big pens.

1,"Disappointed with Grail nibs - do you get your nibs tuned? I‚Äôm struggling with all the highly coveted pens!

Got my first pen as an adult (used one in elementary school), a yellow safari 20 years ago.
Over the last 10 years I‚Äôve used Sailor, Platinum, lamy 2000, Pilot (912, 823, VP), Franklin Christoph 20, and just recently landed a Pelikan m805. 


I judge pens by how they make my handwriting look and the safari with medium nib (I‚Äôve worked on a little bit, some high grit sandpaper polishing) just makes my handwriting effortless and beautiful. I‚Äôve sold all of my gold nib pens besides a Pilot 912 FA and a Sailor Pro Gear because no matter how hard I try, my handwriting looks terrible. With the safari it‚Äôs just effortless. 

The Pelikan m805 is certainly the most beautiful pen I‚Äôve ever had but my god it‚Äôs the same with this nib - it‚Äôs like my hands are allergic. Do a lot of you get your nibs worked on to suit your liking or are you happy with them out of the box?

I‚Äôm just thinking I might be a little crazy that I prefer a $30 plastic pen over a $400 grail pen.
Am I the only one or should I just invest more in getting my nibs tuned?"

Here's what I'm looking for:

* Paper that can handle a normal, somewhat wet fountain pen without significant bleed through (some is okay as long as I can still use the page, no sheen or amazing shading necessary)
* Blank (no printed lines inside, dots are MAYBE ok if they're not too dark and not too close together, but I prefer fully blank pages)
* no design on the cover, neutral colour (brown/white/black/navy/off-white/mustard yellow/olive green/grey/beige)
* hardcover (I MIGHT waver on this if it's a high-quality paperback with a strap to keep it closed, but most paperbacks are annoying to write in on the go)

It seems like this is a thing where I've got to choose 3 out of the 4 criteria, and the fourth will infallibly falter.

My current notebook that checks all these boxes is by the german company Goldbuch, but visiting their website it seems they've discontinued their notebooks without design. Irl shops in my city barely carry anything with blank pages, unfortunately.

1,"Unpopular Opinion: The Lamy 2000's design sucks and it is overrated The Lamy 2000's grip is the flaw that sticks out the most, it becomes extremely small closer to the nib and I am a close griper with big hands.

I also don't like how it looks so brand and un-inspiring. A pen's looks really effects how much I enjoy owning it.

It is overrated. Just because it had a excellent design half a decade ago means that it can stand up to the excellent designs of today. It's like saying that the US Military from half a decade ago would destroy Japan's Military of today just because they were the best at the time. You also have to consider the many advancements and progress that has been made, not just the fame and glory around it.

It's over priced, for a pen worth $200+, it gives you a $100 experience, you can get a pilot metropolitan and it would be the same smooth and bland experience, you could get a pilot e95s or 74 and they would both be a better experience for less cost.

It is carried by it's fame. It if came out just now, no one would bat an eye. But if the Pilot e95s came out just now, it would be a momentous event.

So in summary, it is a bland, un-inspiring, overrated and overpriced, entry gold nib disguised as a grail level pen.

As long as your ink bottle has an opening between 22 and 27 mm and is at least 40 mm deep, these will work.  Just put it into the bottle, close the lid tightly, turn the bottle upside down and the well fills with ink so you can easily submerge your pen to fill it without sticking it all the way down into the bottle.

So I got into all this last year, I think April is my official 1yr. A couple months ago I sold off some  pens along with a case I just wasn't using (a total of 30 pens I think) and so now only really have my nice pens.

I am starting to really see which ones I enjoy. I am about to get a Pelikan m200. This will only be my 2nd pelikan but my first that is ""normal"" shaped, as of right now I have the Pelikan Twist.

I am waiting to hear about a Lamy 2k. 

The only other I think I might get down the road is the Sport Piston because I really like Kaweco pens and I like pistons. 

Id like to buy a Estie Piston Raven but it is hard to find now being sold out at most retail locations also it is one of those pens that is over the 250 mark. I tried other estie pens and wasn't all that wowed by them. 

I still can't bring myself to think about spending over 250 for one pen, though I have had the chance to try pens that are over that, and yes they are nice but I still can't justify it in my budget. Maybe one day something pretty will come along and change my mind üì∑

Unrelated but I'm wondering about the amount of pressure that's needed to spread out the tines. I tried applying a significant amount of pressure and they did open thus creating bolder text. But when I googled people said that in fact, no pressure should be applied, and I might even damage the nib. How easy would it be to damage the nib that way? And how about the pressure? What's a safe amount to apply?

Thanks in advance!"
1,"Pilot PO or Sailor EF for paper prone to feathering? Hi folks, I'm looking for a new pen that can write finely on office printer paper (which is prone to feathering). I'm tossing up between a Sailor Pro Gear EF and a Pilot 823 PO. 

In favour of the Sailor Pro Gear EF, it's a much lighter pen, and I imagine the 21k nib is slightly softer than the PO nail.

In favour of the Pilot PO, I've specifically read that the PO nib defies feathering even on cheap paper.

Has anyone tried either or both of these nibs and could give some insight into their experiences?"

1,"Left my FP at home today, join in my Monday pity. . . Hey all, read my story and join my pity.

  
I got up tired today from waking up to feed the baby overnight and started my morning routine. After packing my lunch box, I got my wallet, keys, and fountain pen (right now its a WingSung 601 Flighter, its such a pleasant pen to use). Today was my first day back after a week off work (staycation, family from halfway across the country came to visit). One of the first things I do is pull up Outlook and go through 100+ emails, what a drag! While going through emails, I see that something needs to be fixed in a database so I go to take a note. I pull my FP out of my pocket and . . . its my recently restored Parker 51 Demi. Two things cross my mind. First, that's not the pen I was expecting and two, this pen is not inked as its going to be rotated to next when the WingSung runs dry.

Now I'm thinking, well I keep a Platinum Preppy at my desk just in case this happens. To my surprise, that is nowhere to be seen as well. Either I lost it or someone took it from my desk. If it was the later, hopefully they get penabled and feel my pain üòÖ. Now I don't have a FP to use at work today and my backup is gone. I can replace my backup no problem but now I got a use a ballpoint pen like a plebeian. I guess this will be a humbling day and make me realize how much I appreciate fountain pens. 

Tell me, have you had this happen? Did you have a breakdown? I'm curious to know."

1,"Pen dries out too fast I bought a new Lamy safari a couple of weeks ago. It is a great pen, but I noticed it dries up very fast. I always make sure to put the cap on, but if I don't use it for one or two days, it doesn't write at all, unless I soak the tip in water (not dipping soaking for at least 15mins).

When i take it with me, attached to my notebook, it is stored upright, if I do that it can dry out even faster. Does anyone know what I can do about it? Or is it just a faulty model that I should return?

For comparison: I also have a Regal fountain pen that works fine even after weeks or sometimes even months of not being used."

1,"I‚Äôm looking for an ink that does good on shitty quality paper I need a ink that I can use on paper that is worse then standard printer/copy paper. I need an ink that does not bleed through like at all, I also would like an ink that will not feather. The reason I can‚Äôt use better paper is because I‚Äôm using it for school where they just give us assignments on the worse quality paper possible. I would like an ink that is black, black-blue or just blue, I don‚Äôt really care. Also a bonus I would be an ink that has high shading but thats not really a priority, another thing that would be nice is a very fast dry time (less than 10 seconds) but again, thats not really a priority. 

TL;DR: The requirements are no bleed through and no feathering in black, black-blue or blue colour and things that i want but don‚Äôt need are high shading and fast dry time.

Also I have tried Waterman Serenity Blue and that bled through the paper and feathered.

1,"Robert Oster Green Green deserves my apologies or: the many fountain pen lessons I learned this week. Last week I posted about how Robert Oster Green Green was my first ink regret.  This week I wish to retract that.

Two nights ago, while emptying my TWSBI Eco of the Green Green, I somehow knocked the bottle over.  It all spilled out, down my leg, pooling on the (thankfully tiled) floor.  My wife heard me swear, then whimper, because I was terrified of what it might have gotten on, and how permanently it stained things.  In the end, I was lucky, it washed off everything, and the large stains on my leg and feet was gone after a swim in a pool the next day.

But, what I saw when rinsing the ink from my clothes in the bathtub, was the most beautiful green water, the perfect bright green I was wanting it to be on the page.  My wife was using a syringe to save the ink pooled on the tiles, so I still have half a bottle.

Lesson 1: Spills happen.

Last night, wanting to write in green, I loaded up my Jinhao 100 with Diamine Sherwood Green, and started writing, and was shocked, it looked almost black.  Flushed the ink out and refilled, and it was the same.  Wrote some more, and realised it was green, it was just a lot more ink going down than the last time I wrote with it.  First sample is a TWSBI Eco M nib, second is a Jinhao M nib.

Lesson 2: Not all M nibs are equal.

Lesson 3: The nib can make a huge difference to how ink looks.

[Sherwood Green in a TWSBI Eco](https://preview.redd.it/4ac33gw6nxvc1.jpg?width=2268&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=26ae7df8eeaefbd9ef27382c581adfba4c39b4c2)

[Sherwood Green in a Jinhao 100](https://preview.redd.it/g02umfo9nxvc1.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=981355314a6c8fb38b1e436fab85d1a09d76efae)

Seeing this, I realised I only tried Green Green in my TWSBI Eco. (The pen is green, it was always meant to be my pen for green inks).  I got another Jinhao, dipped it in Green Green, and started writing.  That's the RO scribble at the bottom of the above image.  It looked brown.  I got my brand new bulb syringe I bought after watching one of Goulet's videos, and flushed the feed, and it spurted some nasty, browny green stuff into the sink, and the converter filled with red when I washed it, even though it was empty, even though I'd cleaned this pen with multiple fills/empties with water before putting it away.

Lesson 4: Just because the converter fills clear when you use it to clean your pen, doesn't mean the pen is clean.

Lesson 5: Buy a bulb syringe!

After all this, for a consistent comparison, I emptied and cleaned out the Jinhao 100 and filled it with Green Green and, well, I think the sample speaks for itself.  Now I'm sad that I spilled it and I'm worried what was rescued from the floor is contaminated with dirt.

Lesson 6: Give your inks a chance with multiple pens and nibs, and work out which they look best from.

1,"Upgrade to Hongdian 1851 Forest Recently got into the hobby and world of fountain pens. I'm looking for advice for an upgrade to the Hongdian 1851 Forest (in Mustard Yellow).

I have a Lamy Al-Star in medium but think the pen is too fat, and the medium Lamy nib just doesn't write well and feels too wide compared to the Hongdian medium. I think I would need a Lamy fine to match the Hongdian medium nib (which I prefer). I also prefer the weight and size (uncapped and capped, but I've been gravitating toward uncapped) of the Hongdian 1851. I like the look of a Cross Century I or II but don't know how it feels compared to the Hongdian. Overall the Hongdian feels great, but it's my first fountain pen and I have the bug to buy a second (technically third) pen that's a little more premium (&lt;$75).

1,"Rules around ink! Have the rules changed around what ink colours are considered suitable and when?

Back in the 20th century only black and blue inks (or blue-black) were considered acceptable for formal correspondence like business letters, etc.

Writing to anyone but a very close friend in red or green ink was considered pretty bad form. Brown was just about acceptable, in some situations because it resembled faded black; same with violet and turquoise which could just about pass as blue. Newspaper editors used to refer to some of the eccentrics who wrote in as ""the green ink brigade"".

Nowadays when so much information is conveyed electronically the rules seem to have been forgotten. Are there any rules now? Is everything acceptable today? What do you think...?"

1,"Pure iron gall ink without dye for fountain pens  Every irongall-based fountain pen ink that I know of contains some kind of colouring agent alongside the IG component. Isn't there an iron gall ink out there with no colouring added? 

I have two pots of iron gall ink for dipping pens and both of these look pure with no evidence of dye. One goes on dark grey, darkening to intense shiny black indistinguishable from India ink; the other is much weaker (too weak, really) it looks browny grey, doesn't darken much, and dries about as dark as pencil marks. I use it for art but it's not really suitable for writing. I'd imagine it's about as intense as the irongall component in most oldstyle blue-black fountain pen inks. I wouldn't risk either of these dipping inks in a fountain pen as they contain gum arabic.

All the IG inks I know of for fountain pens contain dyes of various colours and although some (like KWZ green #1) can look intense and beautiful, I would like the option of a fountain pen ink with just the IG and not the  dye. I don't care if my scribblings are hard to read before they darken. I don't use expensive pens, not that I've had any trouble with IG inks corroding or blocking pens anyway.

Does anyone know of a pure, fountain pen friendly IG that's on sale... or an easy recipe to make one?"

1,"The Wing Sung 630 is very impressive I‚Äôd like to get ahead of any comments about this being a knockoff Montblanc 149 by saying that Sheaffer invented the cigar-shaped pen in 1928 and called it the Balance. MB and others immediately copied them; MB does not own the cigar shape; this pen could never be confused for a MB; yada yada. 

I‚Äôve been fortunate to own a lot of nice pens over the years, including a MB 149 that was a catch and release. I love pens at that are $1 and I love pens that are $1000 as well. 

I‚Äôve also enjoyed a lot of Wing Sung‚Äôs ‚Äúpremium‚Äù offerings like the 618. The resin is solid, the nibs are good, and the filling mechanisms work well. 

These 630s are awesome! I‚Äôm a little late to the party, but the quality is excellent. Brass piston assemblies make them feel substantial, the resin feels essentially identical to my Pelikans and Pilots (and the same as the MBs I‚Äôve written with). 

They come in three colors available in both round and flat top, and each of those models is available with a slotted or open ink window. I think the flat top is a great design if you‚Äôre turned off by pens that look like a 149. The finial is a nice touch. 

The nibs are interesting - #8 size is fairly hard to come by just in terms of popularity. The scrollwork is laser etched rather than stamped, which leaves a bit to be desired. But they write very well. 

The nib pictured was ground by yours truly into a medium architect. Ink in the writing sample is Montblanc Amethyst Purple.  

I‚Äôve seen a YouTuber who has thrown MB and Sailor nibs into these 630s, and it makes perfect sense to me - they are really great pen bodies for a reasonable price. 

I‚Äôd love to see Wing Sung tackle a pen in the shape but not necessarily the spirit of the Namiki Falcon. Truly oversized pens and nibs are in need of a budget option. "

First thing I did was a little inspection with my loupe. Found that the tines were misaligned just a bit. Fixed that. The converter isn't the most well made. The knob is a little loose but the piston is smooth. Saw a little blue ink on the feed so I flushed it. The purple was only dip tested. The flow was nice and wet. A few scribbles drained the feed quite quick. Flushed it again to partially fill it with Take-sumi. At first there might have been an airflow issue. I put the cap on, tapped it on my soft mousepad a few times to hopefully burp a little air into it. After that the line got thicker and darker. It was smoother with the pen angled higher up than how I would normally write. But it wasn't scratchy, just a little more feedback. I might do a little more polishing. I actually like it. It's comfortable to hold, good balance, cap snaps on and off nicely. All for the equivalent of 4 dollars shipped from China."

Can sheen inks cause pen clogging issues like shimmering?

I'm using a lot of them on my pens, and some I didn't even know had some sheen until I accidentally spilled huge drops on the paper (messing up all my work lol).

I would rather not use them, if that's the case, in my pens like the e95s where cleaning the feed and nib is quite tricky.

I bought a Parker 61 and I must say that so far I am loving the pen, it‚Äôs nice and comfortable to hold and use, it looks lovely and I‚Äôve not got any issues with the pen itself as a model. However this one I have bought has a crack in the barrel however it looks really easy to repair and the nib is a bit hit and miss when writing but I think that‚Äôs more to do with how I‚Äôm holding the pen than the pen itself. From using the pen it seems to have a stub nib of some kind as the cross-strokes are thinner than the downstrokes.

This pen has some interesting history though, it has been personalised by the original owner (I am only the second ever owner of this pen), who had it from day one until his death. The family of the man said that he had only this pen in his collection (which I have bought 6/8 from) that had been personalised as this was his favourite pen to use. I know that typically personalisations on fountain pens make them less valuable but that doesn‚Äôt matter to me as, to me at least, these little initials show the history and joy another person received from this very pen, and because of that, they instead add more value rather than taking some away. 

I will use and cherish this pen as I do with all of my pens until the day that I too pass away. And with that said, if anyone has any advice about the pen, especially how best to repair the crack then please feel free to let me know."

I felt safe trying this pen since most of the reviews were about only a few specific issues and were from before or around 2018-2020, so they‚Äôve had lots of time to fix those issues and I haven‚Äôt seen recent bad reviews. 


Really smooth and wet nib, I like it better than my Kak√ºno and Lamy, no hard starting, and the cap looks like it has its own inner seal similar to Platinum‚Äôs design. The snap cap pieces are metal-on-metal‚Äî so the click is very satisfying and hopefully more durable than plastic snap caps. 


Also, can‚Äôt say enough about the geometric design. There are relatively few pens out there with designs like this if you want something sleeker and less chunky than a Kaweco."

1,"2001 Pen Service? I inherited this pen set from my grandfather, and I was just curious if anyone knew anything about them/the company, as I was completely unable to find anything about it on google. It just kept coming up with either other pen companies, or the 2001 space odyssey pen. It came with the case, a fountain pen, a ballpoint pen, and refills for both, (plus the little warrantee/refill instructions.) They are/were a New York based company it seems. The nib of the fountain pen says ‚ÄúIridium Point, W-Germany,‚Äù so it was made some time post 40s, pre 90s at least, (also, anyone know anything about iridium in pens, should I be worried about that?)
The fountain pen works excellently, but the ballpoint is giving me trouble refilling (also I have no idea how to refill a ballpoint pen.

1,"Old Pen Resuscitation Day: Sheaffer Targa 1009s converter alternative A few years ago, I inherited my grandfather's Sheaffer 1009. It's a ~~slimline,~~ gold plated version of the Targa with one of these stunning inlaid nibs - I believe they were initially introduced in the ""Pen For Men"" (PFM) series. This particular model has a 14k solid gold nib that appears to be fine or perhaps even extra fine... The body is decorated with a gorgeous barleycorn pattern.

[Gold-plated slimline body, barleycorn pattern](https://preview.redd.it/c6eixahmvvvc1.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e8c1e79a50899c54a7b0d35290e2a3431f579e30)

[The characteristic inlaid nib](https://preview.redd.it/s7hvvnhuvvvc1.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8652988d939378821a7ce9f35274a2c03628f51b)

The main issue with this Sheaffer was its vintage squeeze converter: while the metallic housing was fine, its rubber sac had largely decomposed, making the pen unusable.

When this pen landed on my lap, I was living in one of those rare countries that don't allow their residents to hold or use foreign currency in addition to having the most corrupt and inefficient customs. So, ordering a converter on eBay wasn't an option.

I've recently moved to Canada and, although second hand Targa slimline converters weren't available at that time, I decided to give the modern Sheaffer converters a try.

The modern version can easily be found on Amazon and other retailers for 10 to 15 dollars. Budget-wise, it beats buying a vintage converter - I recently found one on eBay for 40 dollars + shipping...

When the converter arrived, I connected it with the section and it fit perfectly: the converter's mouth and the section's port were a match made in heaven! I then reassembled the pen and, although there was some resistance, the converter seemed to fit inside the barrel. The problem is, that when I tried to remove the barrel, the converter got separated from the section and was stuck inside the barrel. I could only remove it with a thin, sharp hook - the bottle opener on my Leatherman Wave+ multi-tool.

[See the converter's intact knob: that's the main culprit](https://preview.redd.it/cwtfzoj0vvvc1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef4bffa1d3790da9e564cbeab3076bfd77c78cd0)

[Mouth matches the section port!](https://preview.redd.it/6if4roj0vvvc1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c175369b66b03482be98091cf7137e78afb3c650)

[Converter stuck inside the barrel](https://preview.redd.it/fj3q0pj0vvvc1.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5bf5c316ad1f7f73234cc5db88a015a349f351cb)

After a great deal of frustration, I kinda gave up and forgot about it... until yesterday when I realised that I could try another way to make it fit. See, the ~~slimline~~ Targa's barrel is... slim! Too slim for modern Sheaffer converters. The issue seemed to be the girth of the converter's knob. That's when my Leatherman came in handy again: with the serrated blade, I cut and removed about 2/3 of the knob. As a result, the converter can sit firmly on the section and doesn't budge when I open or close the barrel.

https://preview.redd.it/id3udrjvuvvc1.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=936eead68ff935728c74a89efd4275cb6d383b21

[Sectioned knob. The piston is now protruding because I have filled the converter.](https://preview.redd.it/z4pf6rjvuvvc1.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e2e69b1e43049377f9c84e04ca8d8ec3afebc57)

I can now give a second life to my grandfather's favourite pen, the one with which he wrote entire books. As a tribute to him, I will only use his signature green ink - or something similar because I don't remember which brand he used, but he certainly never used colours other than green. I might also want to improve my handwriting...

https://preview.redd.it/q5inywhsuvvc1.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2cbd052ce34c56b986cf20ba25f8a66a410150fc

TL;DR: Modern Sheaffer converters are compatible with the Targa (and possibly other vintage Sheaffers), ~~including~~ **except** the slimline versions. But you may need to shorten the knob of the converter.

PRO TIP: Don't forget to turn the knob and lower the piston before cutting the knob, otherwise you would damage the piston. Also don't cut too low - keep the knob long enough for you to be able to turn it with your fingers.

P.S.: I picked the Pilot Iroshizuku Syo-Ro ink. It's not as green as my grandfather's signature ink, but this subdued blue-green suits my personality. Iroshizuku inks have good flow and are particularly gentle on vintage pens.

EDIT: I mistook it for a slimline version (the 1009s) but a comment made me realise it was a classic 1009. For a comparison of dimensions, you can check this [site](https://www.sheaffertarga.com/technical%20info/Classic%20and%20slim%20size.html)."

I'm looking to buy a fountain pen for my brother for his birthday and of course I figured the best place to find information about fountain pens is r/fountainpens.

There's a ton of information to take in so I hope someone can help steer me in the right direction.

In his words he's looking for a fountain pen ""with some gimmick"" and he already has a click pen, a twist top and a vaccum refill pen. I honestly don't know what else is there, so if anyone is able to give me a some people it would be greatly appreciated! My budget would be around a 100usd, I'm not sure how expensive fountain pens can get though so I'm open to suggestions above that!

Thank you!

Though this is the 'finest' tip I have, it is a very good writer. It is reasonably wet, reasonably smooth, with audible feedback but not scratchy.

1,"Pen Choices for Long, Slender Hands My current collection has several Safaris, TWSBI Ecos, TWSBI go and a 580,  Kaweco Sport as a purse pen and some Kakunos that I draw with.

Out of all my pens, the Kakuno feels the most comfortable, with the small part of the TWSBI go coming in second. The Kaweco Sport is slender, but it is just too small for me (posted or not) to use on an everyday, long writing session basis. The 580 is the most uncomfortable to write with, with its large barrel.

Overall, I think I enjoy slender lighter, pens the most.

I‚Äôm looking for an everyday carry pen with a better quality than those two, in the $30-$200 range. I was originally looking at an Opus 88 in general as a next pen but I think they‚Äôre probably just as thick as an ECO.

If its not Japanese, I would like something that comes in an EF or F nibs.

If its Japanese, I prefer F or M.

I‚Äôm fine with piston,  cartridge (hopefully with converter option), eye dropper options are okay although I‚Äôd probably prefer the other to filing systems more.

Transparent coloured pens are a plus but solid ones are okay too. 

 Any recommendations?

1,"Replacement body that can hold Sailor KOP nib? So,

I got a Sailor KOP in the Pro Gear Body.

Nib is brilliant, but I can't deal with this body. It's combination of beefy, short and light is very difficult to hold for me. 2 out of 3 would be bearable, but that combination isn't.

I do like larger pens, I find Pelikan M1000s ideal to write. 800s are already a bit small. But they are longer, heavier and thinner than the KOP body.

So yeah, I could see how much bigger a 1911 or Ebonite body is. But I'd prefer to just re-house the nib. Does anyone know a solution for this? I haven't found anything online.

EDIT: Please note that the KOP nib is larger than the 1911, so sadly, #6 options like the Asvine V200 or the Opus88 won't work.

EDIT2: FNF's adapters are out of stock at the moment, but seem the best way to go. I am still looking into #8 compatible bodies here.

I have been watching the classic 1911 KOP for a while and here it comes. I typically don‚Äôt like the thinner Japanese nibs so I was waiting for a B to show up at the right price.

It doesn‚Äôt disappoint. Pen is beautiful and the right size for me.  This is the new nib, I actually like the simpler nib marking. Writing is super smooth and very wet.

I don‚Äôt write anything other than quick work notes.

I rank it on par with the M1000 as far as flagship goes.

I've done some minor penablings around the office. First I brought a box of shark pens, and let people pick their own color of pen and their own color cartridge. That went over well across the board, people thought it was fun and were swimming their sharks through the air at each other.

One of my young coworkers just really seemed to love them. Every week, I'd bring a different pen for her to try. I could tell she *really* liked the flex pens. Her eyes would just light up when I handed one to her. But I wanted to give her something a bit higher quality and less finicky than an Ahab. So I looked around for a while, tried a couple of FPRs. Nibs were pretty good, but I had one leak all over before I got a replacement nib, feed &amp; section. I didn't want her to have a bad experience. Then I saw they now have Jowo #6 housings. 

That opened up a world of possibilities. I had by this point determined that she liked demonstrators and thought the piston fillers were cool. Enter the Nahvalur. Saw that FPR sold it and would put a flex nib in for you. SOLD.

Oh, what a great combination, I just love it. If you have always wanted to try a flex pen, do yourself a favor and start here. Great build quality. The FPR ultraflex nibs have a tiny bit of tipping and write smooth, yet flex pretty easily. Because they're steel, they're less finicky than gold.

My coworker? She's over the moon. I used the excuse that it was to celebrate her new promotion. She loved the narwhal on the box, thought the pen was so pretty, and was so excited about the ""fancy"" Clairefontaine Kenzo journal I included with it. She also thought it was the coolest thing that I had ""custom mixed"" the ink in her pen. (Iroshizuku Syo-ro with a tiny bit of Wearingeul Flame Glitter Potion to give it a little sparkle.) She listened eagerly as I explained that too much shimmer would clog her pen so I had to make sure I added just the right amount. And she nearly squeed when she found the wrench in the box and I told her that was so that she could take her pen apart.

Her reaction was everything I could have hoped. I'm so happy that she's happy and I'm so glad to have a pen friend physically in my life üòÄ All in all? Great success!!!"

1,"What do you do with your extras? This is a silly and stupid question but I am sure I am not the only one with this problem. I found myself spiraling down a rabbit hole trying to replace a pen I broke that I had used to start my first business, buy my first home out of state etc. Because it was more sentimental than an ergonomic or writing preference, nothing ever felt like the ""right one,"" even the same pen in different colors. Now I have a drawer full of pens that don't really have any second hand monetary value, don't get used (or get used begrudgingly out of self guilt), and no one in my life that would be interested in any as a gift. I have 7 different pens inked right now and its a chore trying to rotate them, remember when the last time one was used was etc so they don't dry out. The pens that I actually like the most hardly get used, and certainly don't get used as much as Id like, for this reason. For me the inks and different colors are far more enjoyable then the different pens themselves. I don't even try to get good fills in my pens anymore because I know I will end up flushing them out and re-inking, or changing pens entirely, before much of the ink is used. While some have vastly different nibs and were fun to try, 80% of my writing is on the go in a pocket notebook. Realistically I would be just as happy with 1 or 2 good desk pens (like a pilot 823 etc) and a couple pocket pens to rotate for a change in colors. I have no idea how to downsize without just throwing them away or going through the hassle of mailing a ton of $5 pens out all over the place.

So the TLDR is: What do you do with all the extra pens you own that don't have any real value second hand? Seems like such a waste of space and materials to hang on to them, but what else do you do? Sell a used Mahjon, Metro, Kaweco sport etc for $5 + flat rate shipping? Seems like a lot of hassle and post office waste as well.

Out of the photo below, I realistically only care about and WANT to use:

Travelers brass with a schmidt EF nib, twisbi mini, pilot e95s (maybe the 74 also), brown Prera, Lamy Studio, Hondigan M2. The CH74 and Nahvalur's make nice full size pens for evening journaling at home, and the Eco's are a stub and a medium for my pocket notebook daily headers / using shimmer inks without clogging as much.

The TRC brass, E95s, and Hondigan could do everything I want just fine. Maybe keep 1 stub for headers. If I really wanted to go crazy, an 823 or similar with a piston/converter (743 maybe?) would be a great desk journaling and story writing pen.

1,"Kaweco sport piston filler and TWSBI swipe. Van Dieman‚Äôs inks I recently saw Kaweco were releasing a piston filler of the sport fountain pen. I have had an original sport in black for a long time and really enjoy the way it writes. I also love piston fillers so knew I wanted to give it a go. It writes very smoothly with just enough resistance to avoid that skidding feeling. I teach and mark assessments and book is the bane of my work life, using decent pens and ink are what makes it tolerable for me. I paired it with Sea Turtle from Van Dieman‚Äôs ink as I have to use green ink as school policy. It is perhaps a bit dark but has a nice red sheen. I don‚Äôt want to take that to work, so my work pen is a TWSBI swipe, I have a few TWSBIs and find them just really reliable. It clips to my lanyard and never skips or railroads. I use Huon Pine in this pen, also from Van Dieman which has a much brighter green. Not shared any of my collection in a while and just wanted to update"

I've never seen an ink do this! It's like tearing off a pizza slice lol.

1,"Is there something wrong with my Perpanep? So i brought a new Platinum Perpanep and it had the black ink cartridge with it-I'm guessing it's platinum carbon black.

I cleaned before using the pen and the ink appeared quite washed out. Assuming it's due to left over water in the feed or fin,i cleaned it again and dried as best as i could and used the pigment blue cartridge -but the diluted ink problem recurred.

I switched the feed section with another preppy and currently using the blue black catridge.

Does the platinum blue black appear less saturated?

In terms of styling, the understated, vintage design is close to perfect in my opinion.
Also, the general consensus seems to be that the writing experience is phenomenal.
Still, it is quite the hefty price. 
I know the topic has been talked to death, but I'm still wondering about your concise opinions about the Pilot Custom 823: would you say it's worth it, or are there similar pens in terms of looks and writing experience that you genuinely prefer to the Pilot?"

Bright enough to be an everyday writing inks, its happy, jouyous colour is probably not suited to formal business writing.""

Well-behaved and vibrant, although I'm not sure I agree about it not being suitable for work. (I've recently been taking notes at work - admittedly for myself only - with Robert Oster Citrus, which is very lively.)

1,Bargain fountain pen I went shopping for an ink cartridge (Parker Jotter) at my local office depot. I found this waterman allure fountain pen with no price tag.

I found out at checkout the pen retails regularly for $29.99. I'm not sure if I got lucky or it was due to the camo color. Personally I like the color.
1,"What is the cost ceiling for writing ""experience"" with a fountain pen?  Hello all you wonderful FP loving people! So a few months back I obtained a Pelikan M1000 which was one of several grail pens for me. I got the pen for a great price and love the unique feel of the large springy gold nib. Truly I can see why these cost so much as it offers a different writing experience. 

With that said I'm curious if there's anything else out there I should be saving up for that offers a similar unique experience or have I hit the ceiling for what a FP can offer? For example I also have a Sailor Pro Gear 21k as well as a Pilot 912 double broad with a custom ebonite feed. Both of which write completely different. 

I know Namiki uses unique nibs on their pens that are different than what Pilot offers but didn't know if it's worth the cost or if I'm mostly paying for the time and expetise that it takes to assemble a pen at that price point. Thanks for any thoughts/opinions y'all can offer! Happy writing! "

1,"Seeking Advice: Choosing My First Fountain Pen and Ink Hi there! I'm planning to buy my first fountain pen soon and I'm torn between three options: the **Pilot Kakuno** (since the Metropolitan isn't available in the UK), the **TWSBI Eco**, and the **Lamy Safari**. Specifically for the Pilot Kakuno, I'm interested in a demonstrator, but I can only find it in EF and M nib sizes.

I'll mainly be using the pen on thin, cheap school paper which are ESPO Premium/Classic/Smartbuy (I am a student), so I'm wondering which option would be the best fit for that, prioritizing smooth writing experience (therefore I don't understand what nib size to get). Additionally, I'm considering getting a CON-70 converter for the Pilot, and I'm also in need of a good black ink (I don't mind the price if it is under ¬£20/$20). I've heard good things about the Platinum Carbon Black ink, particularly its resistance to bleeding and feathering.

I‚Äôd really appreciate your help identifying this gorgeous pen. It was given to us by my husband‚Äôs parents, who were given it by a penthusiast to sign their wedding certificate with. 

My MIL saw me writing out our placeholders with my very trusty Platinum Plaisir. She ran upstairs and brought down this beautiful pen. Said that she would love it if we signed our certificate with it. It is such a gorgeous, special, and thoughtful gift. 

The pen is a Sheaffer. They got married in 1991, so I suspect it was made around that year. It looks like a Lady Sheaffer. The nib reads ‚ÄúSHEAFFER U.S.A. 585 14K‚Äù. It also says ‚ÄúSHEAFFER USA‚Äù around the base of the cap. The filling mechanism might be a button filler, but I am out of my depth there.

I would also appreciate any advice on caring for it.

1,"Custom grinds of the big brands. I once stumbled on what appeared to be an old chart of Pelikan nib grinds, which included stubs and obliques. Sometimes you see vintage pens from Pelikan and Montblanc for sale with those grinds, including whopping Oblique Triple Broads (O3B).

I understand why those grinds were discontinued over time. The decrease of FP use and the labour necessary to manufacture them was a nuisance to a dwindling market. However, I have the feeling those days are pretty much gone. Japanese brands offer custom grinds on regular basis (e.g. Sailor's Naginata Togi and Platinum's Music Nib) and there is a market for that outside of Asia. Pilot recently extended its Custom series with many options of grinds, which I consider is a solid indication of that.

With that in mind, I wonder why the big brands are not jumping on the competition. I think Aurora offers custom grinds, but not on regular basis. Leonardo ventured on cursive italics, but they sold out fast with no indication of returning soon. As for Pelikan and Montblanc, I don't think they are interested on that at all.

What are the impressions of the community on the matter? Hope to hear from you."

I can‚Äôt see the nib and it writes a bit broad, it writes broader than I would expect a fine to be and is just a very slightly bit finer than my Pilot Costum 823 in medium.

I am a bit anxious to open it and check the nib.Yesterday I felt like there was a slight bit of drag when writing, but now the drag has disappeared and writing is pretty smooth. If I SLIGHTLY change the angle at which I hold the pen, it starts to drag and doesn‚Äôt really put down as much ink, is it because of the narrow ‚Äòsweetspot‚Äô or is the nib defective?

1,"Fountain pen doesn‚Äôt work. Can anyone help? UPDATE: my pen is working again! Thank you so much for all your help!



About a week ago I bought a fountain pen, a allure waterman to be exact. This isn‚Äôt my first fountain pen, I‚Äôve had one before this one but not a waterman. It is an unknown brand. I bought black ink online because i couldn‚Äôt find them at the store where i bought the pen. I have the pen for about a week now and wrote many things with it.

But the ink doesn‚Äôt flow good. (I don‚Äôt know terms or anything) Every time I‚Äôm writing the ink stops in the middle of a word. Like I said I bought black ink but the ink comes so much lighter out the pen. Sometimes its dark but that‚Äôs for like two letters and it is grey/light black again. I‚Äôve already rinsed the pen with water. And every time I put the pen down (even for like a minute) it doesn‚Äôt want to write again and I need to grab a paper towel to swipe it so inkt comes out. And then it writes in grey.

What is wrong with my pen? What can I do to fix all of it?"
1,"Sailor Profit (1911) Light Shining Red I receives this pen last week but only got the chance to ink today. It is a good entry level gold nib in the Sailor lineup. The medium nib looks like one tip size finer than the Sailor 21K medium nib. It is also slightly finer than my Platinum #3776 medium nib.

There is audible feedback but it is smooth and not scratchy. It is reasonably wet and the ink flow is very nice. It is a joy to write with.

The pen is on the small side to be used unposted. Posted does not make it feel backweighted so this is how I probably will use this more.

The Diamine Ancient Copper is a fun ink. It has nice colour with a hint of shading. I like this pairing a lot.

I will be comparing this with my also new Sailor Pro Gear Slim Four Seasons medium fine nib tomorrow. I have a feeling that the Sailor 14K medium fine nib will be finer than I would prefer but let's see tomorrow. üòÅ

Essentially, this is a blown up BENU pen with the huge amount of sparkly presence. 

I‚Äôve held the pen up to the light and the bottom half of the pen is translucent which I‚Äôm not a fan of considering the price point of this pen. 

Overall, I think I can learn to love it with the right ink in it but aesthetically, it‚Äôs rather displeasing and overtly flashy for my taste. 

With that said, I was hoping to put a purple ink to match but that idea has sailed away. What matching (blue) inks do you think would suit this?"

Information online is scarce and it seems there's a lot of interchangeable terminology.

-I've seen pens and the nib isn't specified. Just Fine, EF, medium etc. But what kind of nib is it usually?

-I love the line variation on the oblique nib I have. If I don't want uniform lines, what nib should I avoid?

-I plan on buying a punch of nibs and working on them myself. Any pointers on what kind of nibs to buy?

-I know there's a lot of confusion regarding Japanese nibs. As I understand it, they mostly function similarly; line thickness depends on the angle of the pen against the paper (upright vs lower down). So does this mean that technically fude nibs are the same as long-knife/long blade/bent nib?

The most expensive of those that I bought myself would be the Lamy Studio. Currently have a broad nib on it and loving it.

The cheapest would be the Faber Castell, but I still frequently ink it up, because it may be cheap, but it's a very nice pen, and one I'm happy to take out and risk losing, unlike the more pricey, or limited edition ones.

The one I've had longest is the Ronson, given to me back in 1990. The Parker 88 beside it is probably of around that same vintage, but I got it more recently. Those were both given to me by my dad. The Twsbi is the newest member of the collection.

I make no claims for the authenticity of the supposed Montblanc beside the Twsbi. I inherited it when my dad passed. He had some others that were definitely fakes. (He never seemed to get the idea that a price that's too good to be true for luxury brands *is* too good to be true.) But this one I'm more on the fence about until I can get someone who knows what they're doing to check it out. Fake or not, it writes very nicely and I use it often.

I grew up using one at school (UK), and then never really paid it much mind. 

When my father passed away a couple years ago, I started using his Montblanc LeGrand Rollerball (shoutout to the person here who recommended fineliners, they‚Äôre great). I use that most every work day and enjoy it.

A couple years back I bought a 146 to go along with it and didn‚Äôt really use it that much. (I asked for a broad and got sold a fine nib‚Ä¶.more on that later).

I started journaling at the beginning of the year and have fallen in love with it! I do 6-8 pages of A5 a day and love using different inks and nibs. Swatched all my inks into a binder (Wearingeul, it‚Äôs a great system) so I‚Äôm all in. Bought a Lamy Vista too, so I have a way to change up inks easier.

I think because of the guilt around selling me the wrong nib (I decided to keep it as is and get a new pen) and it was my bday last week, I was lucky enough to be offered an Origin 149 Meisterstuck. 

It was in my possession for all of 30 mins (it‚Äôs going back to get an oblique broad nib fitted), I still need a new pen! So I‚Äôve been thinking about something else‚Ä¶.and a little more affordable.

Does anyone have any recommendations in the ¬£100/$130 mark? I only really want a piston/eyedropper system. Cartridges are too restrictive and converters are so tiny and just doing the same thing I‚Äôm doing anyway.

From what I can tell it‚Äôs a late-model Parker 51 desk pen. Gonna clean it out tonight and see how she writes. Interestingly, like the Sheaffer Imperial III I also thrifted a little while ago, this one was also made in Canada. 

Shout out to the thrift store employee who had no idea what they were dealing with. "

1,"(NPD) Pilot Falcon SEF My first gold nib, and my first EF! Currently inked with Diamine Ancient Copper. 

The lines produced by this nib are exceptionally fine. I was hoping this would be an everyday pen, but this seems like it would be better for drawing or fancy writing occasions.

Folks who use EF pens, what inks do you use? "
1,"New Here &amp; Nib Advice Brand new here. I fell for fountain pens a couple of years ago. I mainly have some Lami and TWBSI pens that I love, great intro to the world. 

I also have this gorgeous Conklin that I hardly ever use because the ink just.won't.flow. I got mad at it today and just started messing around and surprised myself that it works great when the nib is upside down. It's an Omni Flex nib. 

I'm wondering if I need to do something with the converter, if this is a common problem, or if I should just appreciate that I finally found a way to keep the ink moving."

1,"Asvine p36 &amp; flex nibs the asvine p36 titanium has caught my eye and its within my price range (a rare occurrence among nice looking fountainpens), and I think I'll be getting it regardless of if I can fit a flex nib in it or not as I hear people sing the praise of the default nibs. I saw in a few places that people were fitting no6 nibs into it and I was wondering if the classic choices like the fpr ultraflex would fit in it? Also, if not, would you recommend the bock or asvine nibs (assuming ef for each). I've heard on average bock have softer nibs, which I'd prefer to write with, but most reviews I see say its quite dry to write with out of the box and the asvine is a smoother writer (albeit the line isn't as fine). If I can get the bock to write smoother and wetter than certainly I'd prefer a softer nib, but otherwise the asvine nib sounds like the clear choice (its also way cheaper so there's that)"

Only ink I actively hate is Cinnabun. And not sure about Pick Me Up. Both are scented and do not behave, but at least Pick Me Up has green sheen."

1,"Lost my best fountain pen yesterday I'm a little broken up about this one. It was a Waterman Hemisphere black and gold fine nib.

At some point yesterday, I must have lost my fountain pen because when I reached into my bag to pull it out, it just wasn't there. I don't really deviate from the system in which I transport my pen so I'm not only a little devastated about losing the pen, I'm incredibly confused about how it disappeared in the first place. My only other fountain pen, a chrome Scriveiner medium nib, broke down just three days ago, and so now I'm doing my writing with an office ballpoint pen for the first time in a few years. It's pretty deflating. I've never vented on Reddit before, but this has absolutely got me in the pits. Don't think I can justify buying another expensive pen for quite some time."

1,"Alternatives to Iroshizuku inks Hey everyone, so, there's a lot of things we love about Iroshizuku - the wetness, consistency of performance, lack of misbehaviour like gunk formation. But what's made them stand out for *me* so far:

* They perform well on a variety of paper surfaces, and especially well on glossy paper (e.g., postcards) where other inks I've used typically tend to struggle (i.e., they don't grip on those papers)
* They feel smooth on any nib, whereas, even wet inks from the likes of some Robert Osters might make the same nibs feel scratchy. I suppose this is down to the lubrication of Iroshizuku inks.

So, the problem I'm facing is that the range is limited, and there are some shades I'm looking for, for which I need to venture out - vibrant/ shading greens, for example.

**What brands of ink (or specific lines of ink within a brand) would you say are credible alternatives to Iroshizuku?**

So far, I've discovered the following as viable alternatives: 

* Sailor Shikiori (based on one ink I've used - Rikyu-Cha)
* Diamine 150th Anniversary inks (based on one ink I've used - Blue Velvet)

And inks that haven't done it for me are:

* Most Robert Oster, even the wet ones. 
* Some of the regular Diamine inks (I'm looking at Oxblood specifically)"
1,"A minor tip to prevent post-writing bleeds I take notes at work (Copy Editor) and like to journal as well with fountain pens. Most times, fountain pen ink is obviously not spill friendly or travel friendly depending on weather. 

A good fix is rubbing scentless white candle wax on the page or brushing on microglaze, but I noticed microglaze can be a little more messy or complicated. 

I tried fixative (I paint and do charcoal too) and it tends to bleed when coating the paper, even if it helps, so I thought I‚Äôd share this find.

Might be common knowledge, but you never know! "
1,"Noodler's Black Eel vs Heart of Darkness I have been using Noodler's Bulletproof Black as my edc for quite some time now. It is very dry. Took suggestions from you all and added a bit of dishwashing soap into a vial and it flows pretty well now. Although the flow has quite increased, I can't call it quite smooth and there is nib creep (ugghh).

Recently I got a chance to try the Platinum Carbon Black and I was simply blown away by how smooth it was. But the colour doesn't look as black on paper as Noodler's Black. To be frank, I have become quite accustomed to the blackness of that ink and anything less leaves me wanting for darkness.

After some research I have zeroed down on 2 inks, Noodler's Black Eel and Heart of Darkness. I want the smoothness and don't want to sacrifice the darkness at the same time. Also waterproofness &amp; archival quality is a priority. Which one would be more suited to my needs in your opinion?"
1,"Interesting or unique nibs that fit bock 6 housing?

Thanks for advice. 
1,"TWSBI v Lamy nib sizes? Come payday next month, I‚Äôd like to expand my collection with some different nib sizes.  So far I have mostly EF and F nibs, in various cheap Chinese pens and in Lamy Safari.  I recently bought a KaWeCo Sport in EF and it‚Äôs a pretty good match for Lamy‚Äôs EF nib.

I have a few inks I‚Äôd like to try in broader nibs, so I was planning on buying a TWSBI Eco in M and one in B, with perhaps a KaWeCo Sport in BB.  How do these nib thickness compare with the Lamy EF nib that I‚Äôm used to?  I know Lamy‚Äôs EF is broader than my Chinese pens‚Äô EF, so I‚Äôm wondering if the TWSBI runs fine, being that it‚Äôs from an Asian pen manufacturer, or not?  How do the TWSBI pens hold up with shimmer inks, do they block easily?

I‚Äôm also pondering a Noodler‚Äôs Triple Tail, so any feedback on that would be gratefully received too!"

I was in no rush to ink it up or test it, but since [someone was asking on FPN](https://www.fountainpennetwork.com/forum/topic/374855-pens-and-nibs-for-italic-to-write-this-small/) about the existence of fountain pens that can render Italic script with small x-height, I decided to test the 1.1 nib in this set as supplied, since I'd already worked on the other Lamy Z50 steel 1.1 nib I have a long time ago (to make it write with crisper outlines).

I'm frankly surprised by how this 1.1 nib writes ‚Äî almost like the CM nib on a Pilot Prera Iro-ai or MR ‚Äî and it's rather more to my taste than my earlier 1.1 nib. (The 1.5 and 1.9 nibs in the set also write rather finer than their nominal nib widths suggest.)"

Returning isn't an option since I imported them from Japan... So now I have to find a way to grind this down to a medium or a medium-fine... I mean it writes wonderfully smooth, but it is just too broad for everyday writing and I wanted to make it an everyday writer :(

My ink just dried ran out for the first time with the converter. However the converter did not unscrew at all. What should be my expectation in terms of the screw action of the converter?  Is that supposed to screw downwards while I use the pen and use up ink?  Do I need to hand screw the converter to ensure that I get all of the ink out per fill?  Or do I just use it and when I run out, refill?

Does anybody else have a similar experience? All of my other inexpensive steel nibs (Pilot, Lamy, TWSBI, etc.) write very well on Apica, but the Preppy is very scratchy and tends to skip slightly unless the pen is completely perpendicular to the page, which isn't the most comfortable way to write.

1,"Pilot Capless Rhodium Dear Community, 
i just came back home from my honeymoon in Salzburg (Austria), in the last two pictures you can see some pictures from the beautiful scenery Austria offers.
I want to praise the Pilot Capless, I had a lot of fountain pens, sadly I lost almost all the pens in my collection, I would love to rebuild it, but that‚Äôs a different story. 
I got the Pilot Capless a few weeks ago and it writes beautifully! The position of the clip was odd at the beginning, but it truly offers a lot of stability while writing, a lot of YouTubers say it‚Äôs a fountain pen for quick notes, but I experienced it differently, I could write hours with it! At first, I never thought I would get such a fountain pen because I felt it‚Äôs wrong to not have a cap, but I actually really like it. 
I also wanted to buy a MontBlanc in Salzburg, as they have an official store in the old town.
I tried a few pens out, my conclusion after trying many different of them out was that it isn‚Äôt worth the money, it doesn‚Äôt really feel special to me, I think it‚Äôs more of a brand to show off, but I‚Äôm not the type of guy who likes that. What‚Äôs your opinion about MontBlanc?
The ink I‚Äôm using is Iroshizuku ama-iro.
If you came this far, thank you for reading and have a nice day!
Lovely greetings from Austria!"

1,"What cartridge or converter does this vintage Aurora fountain pen take? I bought this vintage Aurora fountain pen at an antique shop and am not sure what kind of cartridges or converters it may be compatible with.

2. A small code will be written on the right of each entry to indicate the analyzed area; the second letter of each code will be the one analyzed so as to give each pen a fair chance to resume proper ink flow

3. Each second letter will be shown under 20x and 40x sequentially under my stereo microscope

4. For ghits and siggles, I‚Äôll show you all of my pen tips under 40x after drawing a six inch line.

5. My setup if interested

If I get enough positive feedback I will procure a small sample of ink from each pen and analyze using compound microscopy at higher magnifications like 400x and 1000x to observe the colloidal ink particles.

0,"Rollerball refill which feels similar to Frixion? I am looking for a rollerball refill that feels similar to the Pilot Frixion ball 0.7 (blue).

I am used to writing with fountain pens and ballpoint pens but only recently discovered rollerball pens. I had started with a Frixion pen and because I like so much how its writing is similar (ish) to a fountain pen without the extra hassle, I started to look into other ballpoint pens. And I was disappointed every time I tried a new one.

The pens and refills I've tried so far: Parker, Schmidt, Scriveiner and Faber-Castell.  
None of them are bad as such but just so different from the Frixion and not what I was looking for. The Parker and the Scriveiner are a bit closer than the others.

You might now ask what it is exactly that I'm looking for and how the Frixion is different. But that's difficult to explain. (Maybe seasoned pen people have all the right words, I don't.)  
I'd say the Frixion is more ""inky"". It feels better writing and the writing also looks better (to me). I definitely noticed that all the other rollerball pens excrete much more ink than the Frixion. Maybe that's part of my issue, I don't know. And their colours look a bit darker than the Frixion ink. (They're all blue and M.)  
I don't think it's the width of the nib as I also tried fine ones and am equally unhappy with those.

My understanding is that the type of ink is very similar. Although the Frixion ink is obviously a little bit different due to being erasable. Is that enough of a difference that I should maybe stop looking and accept that none of the others will come close enough?

Does anyone have any tips which types of rollerball refills (that's either Pilot G2-style, Frixion or Parker) feel and look similar to writing with a Frixion pen?"
0,"An Homage to the renowned Bic Cristal I really do think the Bic Cristal pen is too often *misunderstood* rather than hated. I decided to make a commemorative post including a brief satisfaction with the Bic Cristal.

I made a post a while back detailing my experience with the 1.0mm diameter. I decided to switch to the 1.6mm and was pleasantly surprised. After a week of usage, I was impressed with:
1. It‚Äôs incredibly smooth feel
2. Wide range of line thicknesses with pressure
3. Rich maximum opacity and legible ink
4. Incredibly affordable and economical (long lasting)
The only real downside I noticed was the frequent ghosting due to uneven ink flow and ball deformities, but it is less noticeable with 1.6mm. It is otherwise very reliable.

Coming from an energel 0.7 daily driver, this pen is great for my schoolwork, and I think it is a cost effective upgrade over standard roundstics (no offense to them though!)"

1. ""Family Dollar"" Stick gel -- the packaging didn't have a brand name or tip size but she thicccccc and has a needle tip which I really really like

2. Pilot G-2 1.0 mm -- I like this one more than the G-2 0.7 mm, and I wish they were just as commonly found

3. Pen+Gear 0.7 mm -- these were a pleasant surprise! pretty bold for a 0.7, but pretty smooth especially considering the price. I got a pack of two for 88¬¢ at Walmart

4. Zebra Sarasa Dry X20 0.7 mm -- zebra did not lie when they said these were made with rapid dry ink lol I got a pack of 8 assorted colors for like $5 at dollar general and I have no regrets. I also like that dollar general sells them as singles too 

5. Loddie Doddie 0.7 mm -- I stumbled on a pack of 18 colors for $10 at tj maxx. never heard of the brand before but I am definitely a fan now

6. Sharpie S-Gel 0.7 mm -- I've seen a lot of positive sentiment about these in here so I was probably a little biased towards them before ever using them but I'm absolutely obsessed and I'm trying to restrain from impulse buying the 1.0s too 

7. ""Family Dollar"" Retractable gel -- another non-branded gel pen from Family Dollar but this one is a hidden gem budget find imo. it stacks up pretty well next to the other typical cheaper brand gel pens

8. Paper Mate Inkjoy 0.7 mm -- I'm an inkjoy loyalist at this point because I've been using the Inkjoy ballpoints for over a decade now but you can't go wrong with these

9. Pilot G-2 0.7 mm -- my gateway gel pens lol a true classic but now that I've expanded my horizons, they've been dethroned. I still think well of them though

10. Uni-ball Signo Spectrum 0.7 mm -- when I first tested these, I thought the ink was taking forever to dry but actually the ink dried fast just very very very not matte, so it looked like it was still wet when it wasn't. definitely the glossiest pen of this bunch

11. Jot Retractable gel 0.5 mm -- decent pen but deceptive packaging. they're labeled as ""ballpoint"" pens which had me shook because I've never seen a 0.5 mm oil-based ballpoint in the wild before, but these turned out to just be basic gels. I also feel like they're more 0.7 mm than 0.5 mm but maybe that's just me

12. Pilot G-2 0.5 mm - I dug this one out from the depths of my spare room closet because I wanted another 0.5 mm to compare with the Jot RT 0.5 and it's the only other black 0.5 that I had. these are okay but I'll never prefer these over the G-2 0.7 or 1.0

13. Pilot Juice 0.38 mm -- my least favorite. I hate them. they're so scratchy I might as well be writing with nails on a chalkboard

14. Pentel Slicci 0.25 mm -- I thought I'd hate this one because of how much I don't like the Pilot Juice 0.38, but to my surprise I actually really like this one. idk what it is about it exactly that makes me like it more, but it's currently the only &lt;0.5 mm gel pen that I enjoy and would buy again"

I needed a ballpoint replacement, but I can't unscrew it to check the type, and after attempting to with a lot of force I reluctantly looked for a guide, only to find that this model is similar to many, but identical to none?  
Closest I've found is the 'VINTAGE PARKER 45 STAINLESS STEEL CHROME TRIM BALLPOINT PEN,  
or the '8587 Parker 45 CT Flighter Propelling in Brushed Stainless Steel.' but without 'Made in England', or a 'repeater'? - click action and a 'conical' end with a grooved tip?  
I've searched all of the historical sites, ebay and here, yet I cannot find any reference of it's manufacture. It's probs a 60's to 80's model if any one is aware of any UK manufactuiring history sites I may have missed, I'd love to know more.  
Regarding unsrewing it, I'm probably just too scared to use a lot of force and too fearful of breaking it, but I'm presuming it's just stiff, and I need to be a little braver, but if this has some wierd twist/pull mechanism, I'm baffled as to how it works so any advice is welcome so I can finish my script with this beauty!

0,"Restoring plastic Parker soft/fiber/fibre-tip refills (how-to instructions) I recently bought a vintage (1970‚Äôs) Parker ""Big Red"" felt-tip pen that came with a dried-up refill inside. It takes standard Parker rollerball refills, but I really wanted to use it as a felt-tip, so I bought several 3-packs of original Parker soft-tip refills on eBay to experiment with. These are the plastic bodied refills that are totally sealed and don‚Äôt have a cap of any sort that can be removed for refilling. You could possibly remove the felt-tip itself, but would probably destroy it (and good luck getting it re-inserted even if you didn‚Äôt). I got these because they were only about $2 each instead of $10 or $20 each like the metal ones that have a removable end-cap. They were all totally dried out, of course.

After attempting to revive them by soaking the tips in water and also in rubbing alcohol, I figured out I‚Äôd need to refill them somehow. After ruining a couple, making many messes with leaking ink, and experimenting with different ink volumes, I finally hit upon a method that really works so I figured I‚Äôd share it

1) Drill a hole in the bottom of the refill. There is a conical depression there so the drill bit self-centers. I had to drill a 1/16‚Äù hole because the needle I had for the syringe is that large. If you have a smaller needle, drill a hole just large enough to insert it easily.

https://preview.redd.it/8giwi830fawc1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=82dc7b1a5979556d8b5bf43e5f682521b38ec70e

2) Remove the white cap and locate the pressure relief vent just below the end of the barrel (marked with red arrow):

https://preview.redd.it/3ruln451fawc1.png?width=312&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=186b7fbbbf9934c1d9f450bd72625048157629b7

3) Hold the refill so the pressure vent is pointing up and the felt tip is slightly elevated, and inject exactly 1/2 mL of ink *very slowly*. If you inject more, or too quickly, it will start leaking from the vent hole either immediately or later on.  I suppose you can use any ink you want to use, but I had read that others had good success with ink-jet ink, so I got this bottle of Epson black ink for $13 (for about 4 oz).

https://preview.redd.it/f78ybl96fawc1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=95ad226fffb098a746960a616a35880969ca461a

4) While keeping the refill approximately horizontal, plug the hole you drilled using some sort of non-hardening putty. I‚Äôve had this tub of plumber‚Äôs putty in my workshop for about a decade and it‚Äôs still as pliable as the day I bought it.

https://preview.redd.it/q9mh47c9fawc1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dd844c679d174ed2fd2e7f9b1119edf5875d4714

5) Store the refill horizontally for 12 - 24 hours and then it will be ready to write. Using this method. I don‚Äôt get any leaks and I can easily remove the putty and refill it again when it runs dry. I don‚Äôt know how long it will last but so far I‚Äôve been using one for 4 days for occasional writing and it‚Äôs still going strong.  I guess this could work for any brand of sealed felt-tip refill, but the ink volume might be different for different brands.

0,"Hoping for information/history on particular Tiffany branded Parker Pen. I was browsing in antique mall the other day and came across what appears to be a black Parker Duofold rollerball that looks like [this](https://www.thepencompany.com/en-us/product/parker-duofold-classic-ballpoint-pen/). What was especially interesting about it was that the top gold piece had Tiffany branding much like some examples I have found online: [here](https://www.ebth.com/items/10522770-parker-duofold-tiffany-co-pearl-and-black-ballpoint-pen) and [here](https://www.ebay.com/itm/204664273521). From what I am seeing, this might be some really rare edition of an already valuable vintage pen. The seller wanted $200 for it, which at first glance seemed high, but now seems rather reasonable given what just a vintage duofold goes for. I couldn't find any examples online that were black, only ones that were marble or blue. 

I don't have many concerns that it was ""fake"" per se due to it's age and wear. I also think it would be rather pointless to fake a vintage pen like this (which would require scale). Does anyone know if this pen was produced in black, or was it more likely that someone in the past just exchanged the barrels? "

I found two Pilot V5s, one black and one blue, abandoned in a drawer for some time and I really liked them when I tried them. When my black pen ran out I tried to buy another one, but the feeling is totally different. The ink seems much more liquid and the line is very thick. Often the ink passes through to the other side of the paper. 
Even its flow seems much rougher and harder.
Is it possible that I bought a fake pen, albeit indistinguishable from the ones I already own, or has the pen changed over the years?
Unfortunately I no longer have the old black pen, in the photo the black one is the new one I bought, while the blue one is the old one I already have.

0,"Light (in weight) pen suggestions for someone with a weird grip? I basically cannot grip a pen properly and I'm never going to be able to. I use my thumb, ring finger and middle finger and hold it at a slant. It puts significant strain on my thumb and wrist when writing especially with an unsuitable pen.

I'm struggling to find a pen I actually like. One thing I've found is that bulky, wide, heavy pens do not work for my grip. The Uni-Ball Jetstream for example is so uncomfortable. (I also don't like the ""finish"" it produces, it looks very cheap to me.) Whereas something like a Uni-Ball Pin is actually comfortable relatively because it weighs less, even though it's a fineliner and not ideal to write with.

I also tried the Signo and didn't take to it. Maybe I need a fineliner that's good for writing, if they're generally lighter in physical weight.

Ideally I'd like to find a pen that is:

* Physically light and skinny
* Produces smooth writing
* Isn't scratchy and scrawny to use
* Is actually enjoyable to use

I'm left-handed to complicate matters further so smudge-free is kind of important too. Multiple colours is a bonus.

I don't want to keep buying recommended pens only to find they're bulky and the same so any suggestions please?"

I‚Äôve been into nice pens for far longer than I‚Äôd like to admit - starting with some cool vintage pens that used to be my grandfather‚Äôs.

Thing is, neither are my favorite pens.

In looking over the Uniball site recently, however, it seems that their other pen types also have variations of their Super Ink (Jetstream, Power Tank, etc) which are also touted as waterproof/anti-fraud, etc &amp; I didn‚Äôt know existed. This led me to wonder: are there any other manufacturers which offer similarly indelible/archival/waterproof/anti-fraud inks? Is there a list, link, or post that shows this info?

For the past few weeks we've been trying to find not only the perfect planner for her, but also a pen that works. We managed to find the planner, but we've been struggling with the right pen. 

This is going to be a lot, LOL but I hope that somebody, somewhere out there, can give us a good lead. 

Basically, we need a metal body .38 mm multi-pin with a variety of ink refill color options, preferably also with a mechanical pencil. The metal body isnt absolutely necessary, but something very durable is. It would also be nice if the pen had some sort of quality comfort grip. Some sort of non-smearing or low smear ink would be great as well. 

We've looked at the uni-ball jet stream, but they don't have the refill variety that she needs to keep up with her daily planning, and it doesn't have the refill options or the durability that she would like. She's starting to develop a little bit of carpal tunnel, so she likes the comfort of the jet stream, but, again durability and refills. 

I've been looking all over Google for something. I keep coming up with dead ends or being referenced to the jet stream. I've even tried looking for something that maybe has empty cartridges that can be refilled with fountain ink, because she does like fountain ink, but either my Google-fu is off or I don't know the right sources to dig through.

If anybody can help us, we would greatly appreciate it. This is a pen that will likely see many years of use, so if there's an investment point of around $100 or so, it probably won't scare us away."

1. this was made in 1980 cause DE is engraved on it.
2. unlike other 45s, its both ends are conical.
3. there is '??????? industrial' engraved on it (sorry for bad eyesight)

What could this be???"

0,"Pen suggestions for Ohto 895NP Needle point ballpoint refill? Does anyone have any pen suggestions for Ohto 895NP (or 897NP) Needle point ballpoint refills, that **aren't** multi pens? I  would really appreciate if someone can suggest some pens, that are still available (even better if it's available in Europe). I've  found some pens from Ohto brand, that would work, but they (as well as original Ohto Horizon pen) are not available anywhere really...

Bonus points if it's a metal pen, but at this point i just want to find at least something that would fit these refills.

I've seen the \[list of compatible pens\](https://www.jetpens.com/OHTO-895NP-Needle-Point-Ballpoint-Pen-Refill-0.5-mm-Black/pd/714/compatible) with these refills on JetPens, but they are mostly multi pens, way too expensive or too thin. I know Ohto has also Slim line, that should take these refills, but, again, it's way too thin for me.

Additional question: this refill is originally for Ohto Horizon (with release button), have anyone tried putting this refill into Ohto GS01, that takes Parker style refill? Perhaps 895NP can be used in it with slight modification?"

I've been on the hunt for polygonal metal-bidy click pens.  I e been working on triangular ones with no significant luck.

I‚Äôve seen a lot of recommendations for the Retro 1951, and it‚Äôs okay, but not really my style. 

Requirements:
- Twist pen - goes into the sleeve pocket of a uniform so push buttons and caps don‚Äôt work the best. 
- Reliable mechanism
- Comfortable, easy writing
- Budget &lt; $100, but negotiable if the other three criteria are met.

I know he enjoys writing but other than how to use one I know nothing about pens. I figured you folks might be able to help me out since you seem so passionate about them!

I couldn't see any FAQ that this kind of post is against subreddit rules, but if so I apologise and feel free to remove it.

For some context my friend's male and in his late 30s. As mentioned he enjoys writing, poetry and lyrics that I'm aware of but he might write longer form from time to time, so I'd like to get him a nice reliable pen to use long term.

Since it's mainly for hand writing I'm guessing something that dries quickly and is easily refillable with minimal hassle would be best. I don't think does he much detailed drawing but I know he likes to doodle a lot while thinking if that's relevant at all.

Budget wise I'd say around $300 USD, but again I know nothing about pens so if that's unreasonable feel free to post suggestions anyway.

0,"Sharpening 'Blunt' Sharpie tips? Myth? Sorry if this is the wrong place to post, But I just spent the better part of an hour googling this and all I could find is posts about reviving dead/dry sharpies with Iso Alcohol. I'm going to be trying that trick on another Sharpie, but for now I'm interested in fixing blunt/""pushed in"" sharpie tips

Has anyone else heard about fixing blunt Sharpie tips by sharpening them? I was informed about this a while back and I totally believed it, that you can sharpen blunt Sharpie tips with a knife, hence the name ""Sharpie"" right? I feel pretty stupid right about now lemme tell you XD After googling this thing for an hour and getting nowhere, I decided to just try it. 

First off I felt really dumb after taking over 5 mins to gingerly take apart my sharpie so as not to get ink everywhere only to find that the only piece inside that really gets you messy is the tip, AND, the tip is very easy to pull out with pliers without taking it apart at all. 

once I got it apart I used paper towel to hold the tip whilst I sharpened it with a razer, which I think likely sucked ALL of the ink out of the felt, AND bled through to my now stained fingers anyways.. (so I will be trying that alcohol trick later but not overly confident) 

Then reassembled my sharpie and not only does it look like total crap and totally wonky, but I'm pretty sure the tip was just pushed in and all I had to do was pull it out and put it back in! (Actually while writing this I realized the sharpie wasn't properly assembled and the tip wasn't in all the way so not even sure if you can just pull them out?)

I've attached pics of the Sharpie/tip afterwards - has anyone else heard this ""tip""? I must say I feel pretty stupid right now A) for believing and B) for really trying it... it's totally fake isn't it? I'll try pulling out the tip on another bluntish one and just putting it back in without sharpening and update with results after.  

[\\""sharpened\\"" tip - looking at it zoomed like this is doesn't look like the worst thing I've ever sharpened, but it's pretty stupid looking once assembled XDD](https://preview.redd.it/oate6cqgv9vc1.jpg?width=2448&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d5930b1271c9af8397f8b37a26741e930ee67ed6)

Alright, so I've been using [this unidentified pen](https://i.imgur.com/L1oxMpe.jpeg) (used to have a clip on the cap) for the entire last decade. It used to be entirely silver, but 10 years of wear + needed a wrench to get the tip off once means there's a ton of the brass showing. I've also completely forgotten where I got it at this point.

I've also discovered (when I misplaced it for a bit recently) that exclusively writing with this thing throughout all of college means the vast majority of my lifetime notetaking was done with this particular pen, and I legitimately cannot write quickly with any other pen now. I'm not actually entirely sure why honestly, but I kind of just want to find something similar so if I actually lose this one my notetaking speed doesn't take that hit.

It seems this type of stepped tip with no taper is mostly seen on drafting pens, but I just want something with a similar tip that takes generic gel refills (like [these](https://www.amazon.com/100pcs-Refills-Needle-Liquid-Rollerball/dp/B07L9VTHM9), they're incredibly cheap and write very well).

Probably mostly care about the body diameter (~11.25mm), tip diameter where your fingers go (~9.2mm), and profile (stepped cylinders instead of having a cone tip). Would prefer a metal pen so I can also use it for a solid decade+

I used to jot down a few lines a few times a month, however now that I‚Äôm writing pages a week, I‚Äôve noticed how much I can‚Äôt stand my usual pen. For reference, that would be the 0.5 Uni Jetstream, which was my favorite pen until I started writing a lot &amp; more frequently. The ink skips &amp; I often have to stop every couple of *letters* to scribble the ink out. All of my refills have acted in the same way.

I recently got some Muji pens because they come in .38mm tips; I write small so a tiny tip really helps. I love them, however they smear with water so I‚Äôd like to stop using them asap. Archival ink is really important to me because I use my notebooks as personal reference + I‚Äôm a klutz.

I have a Pilot Juice coming in the mail so I have *something* to write with until I can find a more permanent replacement. I‚Äôm hoping to get some suggestions so I can stop buying plastic pens that I‚Äôm not going to use.

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm looking for:

* Small/extra small tip size
* Waterproof/water resistant
* Archival ink
* Refillable body to reduce waste
* $35 (US) &amp; under
* Will NOT skip or go out every few seconds

I‚Äôm open to rollerball, gel, &amp; even fountain pen (though I have little experience with these, so please give explicit details if suggesting one) so long as I can get a steady flow.

I prefer stick over retractable pens anyway so I was contemplating trying the 101 stick pens but not if the writing experience for those (medium point) is similar to the RT since I still use a cheap spiral notebook for work.

0,"The Uni Power Tank is easily the best writing pressurized refill I am comparing to:

1. Fisher Space Pen
2. Schmidt Megaline 
3. Tombow Airpress
4. Zebra Wetnie

The Power Tank writes almost as well as ***Jetstream*** on paper, which is a remarkable feat for a pressurized refill. It has almost zero skipping and railroading, which is even more impressive. 

For those wondering why this is so impressive for a pressurized refill, pressurized refills tend to use higher viscosity ink, this makes the writing experience on paper much less smooth, and requires you to apply more pressure as well.

The black ink is also quite saturated, comparable to a gel pen. So it's even blacker than Jetstream black.

\--

The only downsides to the Power Tank are:

* The 1.0mm doesn't come in blue, only black and... red for some odd reason. 0.7mm has blue.
* The refill is ***THICC!*** ***None*** of the popular machined pens (Tactile Turn, SPP, Autmog, Big I Design etc.) can fit it at all because of how thick the refill is. Needless to say, you cannot cut the refill down to shorter length either. I have found not a single other pen body that will fit the refill.

\--

TLDR:

If you want a pressurized pen to write on paper, this is the best option so long as you don't mind black only and not being able to use the refill in any other pen body."

0,"I got The Platinum Desk Pen Stand for my Platinum Desk Pens I'm not sure if they're supposed to sit in like this however this setup makes me feel like the president of the world with Mr. Eric Crabton as my secretary.

This desk pen stand was the probably last in stock in my country because it's sold out on every website and none of the stationaries even seem to be aware of its existence. 

It's quite light for what it's supposed to do (made of acrylic) since putting the pen in and taking it out seems to move the base around which is quite a bummer. 

The caps are mounted on some sort of a ball socket pivot which helps you angle it to your preference. It's sturdy enough to not move around with the pens weight. 

I originally wanted the other black and gold stand which seems to be heavier and fits the pens better and would blend better with my setup but this is also fine. Just wish it were heavier. 

Worth the price of about 30 USD that I paid? Hell no. Maybe if it was for 15 I wouldn't have mind that much. I feel like I should've just mounted the original caps to my pen box myself and built a better stand. It looks pretty and it's a finely made product, I'll give it that. "

This schedule is created in Excel and certain rows are color coded, and I print it in color. 

My problem is, as I try to write on this print out, especially on colored rows, pens tend to take on that ink or wax of it or whatever and the pens start skipping and I'm constantly scribbling everywhere to keep it writing. 

Ballpoint works best, but even those end up skipping. Felt tip works well but I'm in a dirty environment sometimes so those just absorb the dust and what not and start skipping too. Plus the writing area is small so felt tip isn't always easy to fit in there. 

So...what's a good .7mm tip that can write on just about anything with nice dark lines...with blue ink.

I know that the refill has also been called a standard Japanese style gel refill. So I'm wondering if there is such an animal as a ballpoint ink refill alternative.

0,"Standard company disposable pen, but wow It's got a soft rubber grippy body but it's made of metal in metallic blue so it's pretty, and hefty, which I love. It's retractable - I hate caps - it has a stylus pad on the button which is really useful for when I have to sign drivers' electronic pads at work, and the ballpoint is smooth as silk. It makes my Jotter feel like scratchy crap, honestly. Probably the perfect pen. 

Now I just need to find out what it is so I can EDC it for the rest of my life

0,"Fidget Clicker I have been using the Zebra Blen as my main pen for my job for over a year now

I believe they came out the same time as the Pentel Calme and answering similar brief stories of being less clacky, rubberised grip may also be ideal for those with OCD/sensory needs

The pentels I left mostly unused as I found the clip/Clicker hurt my hands/thumb the way I hold them and fidget click during the day 

The Blens are perfect for those that like clicky button like mechanical keyboard and such

Too bad they seem a bit over designed with double shot plastic body in the grip with viewing window that's useless to view the levels of inks left in the refills

Manufacturing wise the Calme seem to be made of the same material throughout yet managed to produces different texture for the grip which is nice, too bad the clip Clicker dig into my thumb The ink on the Calme seem like normal ballpoint while the Blens is what's expected of modern gel pen"

0,"149 vs LeGrand I'm in the market for the 100th anniversary collection.
I'm perfectly happy with the legrand, but I'm wondering if upgrading to the 149 is worth the additional $250? I understand it's physically bigger and has a 18k nib, is that a far superior quality than the legrand? Or is the 14k nib good enough?
I'm also thinking of the 149 because to me, Montblanc is supposed to be black. But I'm questioning if the $250 is worth it. Please help!

0,"Rugged, comfortable, blue, left-handed Canadian pen recommendations  I work in a military metal shop, and that leaves me with a couple of requirements for the pen I use. It needs to be durable, ideally all metal, with blue ink. 

I've been using a modded all metal Zebra for some time, I'm looking to upgrade. 

I was thinking of the Rotring 800, but the included ink doesn't seem well-liked, and a lot of the recommended refills which I saw suggested in this sub had people complaining about the ink drying too slow for lefties. 

So I'm looking for recommendations either for Rotring 800 refills, or completely a completely different pen/refill combo which might suit my needs. 

I'm open to mass-produced or more niche pens, full sized and comfortable because I have carpal tunnel, so writing can be miserable enough as is. 

Ideally I wouldn't have to jump through too many hoops to get a hold of any suggested refills in Canada. 

Sorry for all the criteria, hopefully someone can make a suggestion. Thanks in advance! "
0,"Refills sale I was happy to get an email from Pentel today advertising their sale on refills. I've long been bothered that many pen manufacturers sell many pens with different color inks (purple, brown etc.) but don't sell refills other than the standard colors (black, blue, red maybe green). 

I'd like all pen makers to sell all their refills in all of the ink colors they offer for their pens. I realize that physical stores may not want to maintain a large inventory but I don't see why online retailers (or the manufacturers themselves) can't make them available for purchase.

Maybe we have to start a petition?"
0,"Zebra Expandz SL-F1 ink alternative I don't like the ink quality that the pen comes with. The ink is a bit dull and comparable to generic ballpoint pens, so I ""made"" my own. Here's what I did. I really like how smooth the ink of Pilot pens are (especially the Hi-Tec C ones), so I cut a Pilot Hi-Tec C Coleto (0.5mm) refill to the same length of the Zebra refill and removed the plastic end. To compensate for the thickness, I cut a portion from an empty refill of a Hi-Tec C pen refill and placed some tape on the Coleto refill so it doesn't move. Now I have a Zebra Expandz that writes better. I hope this can help someone else in the future. üòÑ"

0,"[LONG POST] a Bazic dupe of the Mildliners I recently stopped by a local dollar store to pick up some batteries; but like always I find myself snooping around the pens and pencils aisle ... and found something ... Interesting 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/cvkhqlbq0qsc1.png?width=1960&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b81eef674f25f76b993884fad41678b271972104

a Bazic marker set ... that looks a Lot like Zerbas Mildliners!

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/daklz2l71qsc1.png?width=1960&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=24ec29d9b9bba9715ad2197e537c69fba68f54f3

Well, thankfully for you (and me) I actually have a similar set on hand! (excuse the butchered packaging, they are a few months old.)

 

https://preview.redd.it/ntjtexju1qsc1.png?width=1960&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fa0a332a719c888ceb0b704b9c589b23f6085e9c

the packaging themselves are pretty similar, but just enough differences to make them pretty distinct.

and unlike the mindliners, the Bazic set actually names their colors...

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ums72q842qsc1.png?width=1960&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=def65dbb69b178d854b15ab6329dd5f69cdfca6c

looking at the pens themselves, you can kinda see a resemblance ! but the green for the Bazic marker is off. a bit more cool and brighter

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ul5izx0g2qsc1.png?width=1960&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5cbb0ae76161cd1bb66223f04d07a53312e27dc7

The sides of the zebra markers share a lot of info about them, the Bazic set just links to their site and their company location, not pictured; but it does Also say that the markers conforms to ASTM D-4236 and are non toxic, like the mildliners.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/13cyj4er2qsc1.png?width=1960&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a504ba9351202eb1a0aa60d017cda7da8eb535cc

taking off the caps, their differences are even more apparent, the chisel is taller and thinner than the mildliner, and the bullet tip does look a bit smaller, as well as the holders being the color of the marker instead of a white.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/66ylpyra4qsc1.png?width=1740&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0c173044df2d2fd5890bbb29d8e6ffedc33f8871

okay, now for the fun part, how do they look on paper?

Answer? pretty different ... and they felt a littler different too

mildliners chisel tip always felt smooth and soft to use, the bazic just felt kinda like a normal highlighter.

though interestingly, the bazic's bullet tip felt a bit softer than the mild liners, i could feel the tips mush up when i used light pressure, no damage though.

and the most interesting thing about it? the red's bullet tip was the firmest, as opposed to my mildliners red being the softest feeling.

the colors are pretty different from the mild liners, mild yes, but the green is more of a sea foam green, the gray is just a bit darker, and the purple is more pinkish and bright.

the blue and red look the closest to the mildliners.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2q717swy4qsc1.png?width=1960&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f078e6aef6e89a79e47573ce9d189d01387fc9bd

one more test, how to they highlight? kind of similar... nothing to rave about.

from top to botom the inks i used were

gel ink (a pilot precise V5 rt)

a felt tip (a sharpie pen)

ballpoint ink (blue bic pen)

and 0.5 2b pencil lead.

i dont really use mildliners to highlight what i myself wrote, but the Bazics worked better than i thought they would! especially on the pencil.

&amp;#x200B;

My take away? I was expecting this review to be a bit more negative, but im not too upset with how they turned out to be, maybe just interesting.

I will say, the bazics Are cheaper than the mild liners, it was 3.99 USD for the Bazics and 9.99 for the mildliners (i think you could find them cheaper, my college store seems to upcharge a lot)

&amp;#x200B;

Do i recommend you get them?

I think thats up to you! they work well from what I see, so if quality is a concern I think you'll be alright.

maybe my only concern is the colors themselves and also that they. Arent mildliners. 

but if that isnt a concern to you, I wouldn't sweat it really. buy what you can afford and you feel happy using. thats all

sorry for the long post. have a nice day! :3"

BUT, this is the second M405 I've carried because the end cap on the clicker fell off my previous pen.  Pelikan does not offer spare parts for the M405 ballpoint.

So I purchased another M405, figuring it was a 'one off' defect.

Nope, the shiny end cap just came off my second M405.  That's $400 I've spent on pens which are now relegated to the junk drawer.  I don't mind spending more for a premium product, but if you offer no customer service, you are NOT a premium manufacturer.

Do better Pelikan!

What alternate do you recommend?  My brand loyalty to Pelikan is somewhat strained right now.

I can‚Äôt write more than a few lines before my fingers start to cramp, which also makes my handwriting look even worse than usual. I had heard people complain about the grip being slippery on the fountain pen version and it‚Äôs definitely true of the ballpoint version too. Not recommended. I prefer my Parker IM or my Conklin Duragraph (which is thicker and also looks beautiful)"
0,"Identification Request Picked this up at a pretty nice hotel...was surprised and also impressed there was no marketing on it.  The metal body has a good heft to it and the pen itself is slender.  Looks like a pretty generic ballpoint reservoir.  There are no identifying markers I can find on the outside or within the pen.

The body design looks very similar to some ystudio pens but I couldn't find anything exactly like it on their website.

I thought I had found the perfect ""fineliner"" pen, at least perfect in terms of scratchiness and ink properties (archival quality pigment ink). At first I was really happy with the plastic nib feel but it seems it wears down really quickly - I bought 3 PNs to test and the first two have visibly shorter nibs after being used to write \~10 A4 pages of text. What's more, they are losing their ability to write at an angle (I keep comparing them to the brand new third one to check line widths and ease of writing at an angle).  
I am writing on 100 g/m\^2 acid-free paper in Leuchtturm1917 notebooks.  
Can anyone point me to alternatives? I am willing to try anything if I can get my future notes to look the same as in the picture (and still use archive-quality ink). In the picture is a Micron PN I have used for 9 full A4 pages (left) next to a brand new one (right).  
It seemed like the perfect hassle-free (relatively) cheap option and now I'm stuck.

0,"Personal Collection After Dropping Into The Ballpoint Pen Pit It was an unspoken family tradition for everyone to own a pen collection in my house and it really wasn't until my Dad, who passed away from cancer, asked me to inherit his collection of Mont Blanc and Sheaffers six months before he passed away did I put any thought into the subject.  
Knowing how important that pen collection meant to Dad and how terrible I am with fountain pens, I've decided to keep Dad's collection as is. It wasn't until some office politics (it's a story that's really hilarious) that broke the camel's back did I actually went down the rabbit hole and started my own collection a month ago.  
After trying out some ballpoints from my older brother's collection, I mainly settled on the stainless steel Parker Jotter as it fits my need for a personal pocket pen, is impervious to my sweaty hands and most of all, it has a wide variety of refills to choose from. I also find other more expensive machined pens to be a distraction for me and it would be better to keep it simple. The size of the Jotter was already a nice figet spinner and the clicker was a ton of fun to fool around and annoy your co-workers with, so in the end it was the perfect match as the main work horse of my collection.  
Currently the three original stainless steel Jotters are for work and was fitted with a Parker 0.7 Gel, OHTO PS-107NP 0.7 Needle Point and a Schmidt DSM 2007 mechanical pencil. It's what I called an everyday working set as it contains the essentials of what I need for work. Also the silver stainless steel body is ideal in the office, as working in East Asia, everyone hates you standing out and would even get you summoned to management just because you used a flashy pen when you were not in the correct position to use one.  
The Kensington Red and Royal Blue Jotters are my personal writing and signing pens. As for now they're fitted with Black and Blue Quink Flow refills, and is mainly used for signing and scribbling down  notes. I've only came to realize that those silver and dark blue pens with chrome tips that my parents, aunts and uncles used to carry were Parker Jotters after I've start using Jotters myself. In the past, I always think that high end ballpoints were in the form of dark blue Jotters or gold/silver Cross ballpoint pens, so for me, the iconic hallmark of a ballpoint pen might just be a dark blue Jotter that was most commonly seen wielded by my elders. I guess owning a Royal Blue Jotter is just a nolgistic  sentiment I have for my elderly family menbers. The gold trimmed Kensington Red though, that's just there to piss off my boss and co-workers when signing on important paperwork. lol  
The centerpiece of my personal collection as for now might be the Parker 75 Sterling Silver ‚ÄúCisel√©‚Äù ballpoint. It's a new old stock and at the point I bought it, I literally knew nothing about what the heck was a Parker 75 and why it's so pricey. At that time I just felt right about this ballpoint, I knew liked the design a lot as it reminded me about Dad's light grey lattice suit he always wears on casual family occasions when I was still a kid, so I bought it without too much thought. It was a pen that reminds me of my Dad for no reason, so I guess that's why I felt right about it. The seller estimated it dates back to 1972 and to my surprise, the original T-Ball Jotter refill still works even better than the Quink Flows after 52 years in the warehouse. My Parker 75 Sterling Silver ‚ÄúCisel√©‚Äù is that special pen that's reserved for special occasions, so I usually reserve it for personal use and rarely brings it out for work.  
For the extra refills I picked the Pelikan 337s since it felt the closest to the T-Ball Jotter refill in overall performance. Quink Flows just don't feel consistant and you either get a good one or a rough one depending on luck. Considering how much I like oil base ink and the T-Ball Jotter refills, I guess that's the closest I can get to a T-Ball Jotter refill in 2024.  
That OHTO PS-107NP 0.7 Needle Point is also a great refill though, and even though I personally don't like needle points and only use it specifically for work, it's still an excellent refill that I recommend using. It's a 0.7 that writes like a 0.5 and is the only needlepoint that didn't bend or break under my heavy handwriting.  
As for now I'll only be sharing my own collection of ballpoint pens. Dad's fountain pen collection, though small and not exotic, is a lot more interesting then mine, but the legacy it bears is something I'm not ready to share without bursting into tears. I sort of get why he was always trying to nudge me to get my own collection throughout the years and find the pens that are right for me after I started to essemble my own pen collection last month. Well, in memory of Dad, I guess falling into this pit isn't a bad thing.

 Impulse buy from Walmart.  I've bought Pen + Gear dry erase markers  before - too inky - but 88 cents for two gel pens is the very definition  of cheap impulse buy.  They're pretty good, just two gripes: one of  them doesn't retract very smoothly but it's workable (the other one  retracts perfectly fine) and they do bleed through a bit in my work  cheap spiral notebook (also Pen + Gear) but these are medium point and  that's why I prefer fine point for non-ballpoints.    Overall not bad otherwise, smooth writing experience.  I doubt I'll  buy them again but at this price I'd try them out and you'd think they'd  be cheap crap but they're really pretty good.   "

I travel between a lot of work sites in a day and a portfolio is easier to carry with me from site to site than a briefcase or backpack. A legal pad for jotting notes, some pockets for papers, pen, business cards, etc. I‚Äôve used the faux leather ones in the past, but I wear them out too quickly. I need a high quality, full grain leather portfolio. I recently bought one from Saddleback Leather and while the quality was fantastic, the size was ridiculously big.

0,"Sarasa Grand update - first impressions Overall, I like the update.

- Biggest change is they modified the clip and clicker so you wouldn‚Äôt bang your finger or thumb every time you click the pen.

- Included ink is the standard Zebra Sarasa 0.3mm or 0.5 mm gel - I prefer something a little bolder so I will eventually swap the inks out for Energel 0.7mm or maybe a hybrid ink.

- They also changed the metal used (heard it was brass ‚Äî&gt; aluminum) resulting in the pen being lighter than before, 25 grams ‚Äî&gt; 19 grams. I was actually surprised the new pen weighs that much, it feels very light in my hand.

BTW I got these from Amazon Japan - the shipping cost was significant but with the current exchange rate the pens cost around $7 each.

My question for all of the lovely people here is: what are your favorite  . 38-.5 rollerball refill options?

 Half the reason I got this for him is because he has trouble finding anything below .7 and it has to be rollerball because of his job (and general dislike for gel smudges). Hybrid would also probably be fine but it would need to be fast drying.

0,"MontBlanc StarWalker Refills Alternatives Hey there,

I bought myself a MontBlanc StarWalker BlackCosmos Fineliner/Rollerball last summer, as a small of motivation for ink sketching, and I really loved the overall performance of the pen. There is one downside though, when it comes to art: ink bleeding. 

Most of my art, I do with pencils [or digitally]. I was always a bit afraid of using ink pens since I tended to ruin my pencil sketches at times - I just don‚Äôt have the experience yet. Anyway, I purchased the MontBlanc Fineliner/Rollerball as a motivation for myself, to start inking my sketches, and after a while, I finally decided to trace one of my sketches with the MB Fineliner ‚Ä¶ oh, boy ‚Ä¶ what a nightmare.

After each drawing, I use a fixative so I don‚Äôt smudge any of the pencil strokes on the paper ‚Ä¶ and I did it after using the MB Fineliner as well [by mistake, tbh]. The result was me tearing out the first page of a brand new sketchbook. Luckily it was just a ""quick sketch"" of roughly 2 hours - it took me less than a second to ruin it, though.

MB ink &amp; fixatives don‚Äôt mix well. The ink starts bleeding through the paper, and acts similarly to watercolor, but in a ""less beautiful kind of way"".

Recently, I also purchased some MB Rollerball refills, to test these ones out as well. The result isn‚Äôt marvelous, to be honest , but it‚Äôs okay-ish? All my refills are in the color 'Mystery Black', and the Rollerball ink does quite literally bleed through the paper [when applying a fixative], because although the black ink stays in place (the Fineliner doesn‚Äôt stay in place at all, in comparison), it gets a red kind of 'halo effect', where it bleeds outside and through the paper, but only in a soft red tone.

So, if I had to decide between the two, the Rollerball is the safer choice. Now, why do I apply fixative on an ink sketch? Well, I don‚Äôt [always]. Sometimes, I don‚Äôt erase the graphite underneath, and I may have forgotten to apply fixative beforehand, or I‚Äòm just doing a pencil sketch on the second page of the paper, applying the fixative on the sketch afterwards, but then the fixative goes through the paper, reacting with the ink sketch on the first page ...

The best result you‚Äôll obviously get with pens like 'Faber Castell Pitt Artist Pen', but I want to know if there are better options for my MontBlanc pen out there. After all, it would be a waste if I couldn‚Äôt use it properly now, just because MontBlanc's ink is water soluble.

I mean, why even is that? I wouldn‚Äôt want water soluble ink on important documents either. Why do such expensive refills perform so cheap in this regard?

Cheers
Liv

0,"Boy, I really love the BIC Cristal I don‚Äôt know where else to sing my praises but here - but among all the pens I‚Äôve owned so far I keep coming back to old-fashioned BIC. 

Other than the fact that BIC probably accounts for a huge amount of plastic waste and other environmental hazards in the global manufacturing industry, the pen is a marvel of engineering. [Of course this doesn‚Äôt make all that okay]

For the time we still have with it now though, It‚Äôs like holding a piece of history, the Cristal does. It‚Äôs sleek and recognizable and uniquitous; you spot it in plenty of shows and movies, in offices, classrooms and cafes. You can‚Äôt help but feel like you‚Äôre connected by it to the rest of the world in some weird way.

You see those old BIC ads with those unique and sleek drawings and are reminded of how this was the same tool that made the latter half of the 20th century possible. You don‚Äôt know what great people have held this same pen and used it to sketch out or write the most important ideas of our age.

Of course it just so happens too that the pen fits my hand and style better than any other pen I‚Äôve owned. The deep royal blue of the ink is my favorite and no other pen has captured it the same way BIC does. The skinny body is a perfect grip that doesn‚Äôt intrude too much with my finger movements.

0,"Advice or alternatives to Microns I‚Äôve recently started using Microns, but I‚Äôve been having issues with the nibs being pressed down really fast. I‚Äôm a college student and usually take a LOT of notes so it‚Äôs common for me to go through pens like crazy but I basically went through my Micron 005 in one day? I write pretty small and it lasted nearly 30 pages, but I‚Äôm curious why it‚Äôs the nib that‚Äôs giving me issues and not the amount of ink like I‚Äôve always experienced in the past.

I have dysgraphia and ADHD so I know the way I learned to hold a pen is a bit different than others (I think my roommate said the grip is called lateral quadrupod? If anyone knows what that is lol) and I tend to hold the pen really close to the tip nearly perpendicular to the page, so is that why Microns may not work for me? I do try to write lighter and I‚Äôve gotten fairly good at it but it could be possible I‚Äôm pressing harder at times without realizing it, I still struggle with consistent pressure when writing.

I‚Äôve tried a fountain pen for awhile (Lamy Safari) and tried to train myself to use the ‚Äústandard‚Äù grip at more of a 45¬∞, but it still felt so awkward and I struggled to keep up in classes even after a month and a half of only using that grip. The other pen I‚Äôve used that I‚Äôve enjoyed was the Pentel EnerGel 0.5 (not too sure on the size) but I could easily blow through a refill in a day and it did start to skip after while which drove me crazy.

Here‚Äôs what my brand new micron looked like compared to my old one roughly 12 hours apart and my handwriting with it if that helps!

Once, my notebooks were very wet, but those with uni-ink were survived, and since then, even though I prefer energel, I am staying with uni. Particularly with 207, 307, and jetstream. Also power tank for special occasions.

I like uniball one, but using only refills from that, but not the body itself..(maybe best body is from 207 because it has a metal clip) and the refill from the ‚Äúone‚Äù should be tested on site, otherwise better buy refill in package. Also check the produce date which is imprinted in refill..

0,"Larger Pen recommendations Good day, 
I tend to write for longer periods of time with pen and paper taking notes.  I am an adult male with normal hands and prefer a larger pen.  I have been considering either a Pilot Dr. Grip Center of Gravity or a Uni Jetstream Alpha Grip.  I have tried the ""consumer grade/box of 12"" Uni Jetstream and the Pilot G2 and like them but want something a little larger, less disposable and a tad nicer.  I am thinking of spending up to $15 per pen (USD) is my range but would stretch for the right tool for the job.  I might add, I also prefer ballpoint as don't like the way the ink soaks the paper from rollerball pens.  My question is: should I be looking at other pens.  

I might add, I have looked at the Kaweco Classic Sport Ballpoint and Kaweco Sport and am curious.  I did look at and rule out the Zebra F-701 as I found it a little too small. 

lastly, I do like the Schmidt ball point refills, so bonus points if I can use those.

0,"Purchased the Pentel Q-Erase! Inspite of my budget being pathetically low (150 INR ~ 2$), I was adamant on getting a mechanical pencil, as I wanted to feel the difference as compared to a regular one.

My options were limited to the  INR 150 Kuru Toga Standard, the INR 50 Pentel Q-Erase and the Uni-Shalaku S. There were several other INR 10 or so options that I haven't included, as I didn't want a extremely cheap one.

A friend of mine who's luckier than me :p had many more options and I've tried those he owns, which include the Uni Kuru Toga Advance Upgrade, the Pentel GraphGear 1000, the Rotring 300 and a Pentel Twist-Erase/ Tombow Monograph (can't remember which). 

I ruled out the Kuru Toga Standard from my options as on trying my friend's Advance Upgrade, I noticed that I didn't like the squishing every time I touched the tip to the paper (I put a lot of pressure and keep on manually turning while writing anyway). I liked the Shalaku but was told the side click button gets in the way, which left the Q-Erase.

The shop I went to had the Q-Erase, the Staedtler Graphite 777 (which felt too plasticly) and the Uni Shalaku S.
On testing the 3, I found that the side click button of the Shalaku was slightly annoying, but could be dealt with. However, based of reviews and and the brand Pentel, I opted for the Q-Erase (QE427) as my first mechanical pencil.

Really excited to enter this world and will give a review soon once I open it. Another question for ya'll - which lead do I pair with it ? I've got 15 or so of the Camlin HiPar 0.7 60mm B leads. Will these work or should I switch ? (Pics attached)

I also have some Uniball One F and One P. I love the 0,28mm Signo refill feel wise(feedback) but it constantly skips since I write with very little pressure.

So what I am looking for is a good pen, with a good, thin writing (.3 and under) gel refill, that doesn't skip.

Or just a refill recommendation that fits more pens so I can pick out a pen that I like for it.

0,"Schneider RECO, made in Germany pen for Parker G2 refills &amp;#x200B;

[Schneider Reco](https://preview.redd.it/uo3ciawi2fqc1.png?width=754&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=71f8230d82d66336e6424eaec4a75eb353f456db)

You can find these on both Aliexpress and Amazon. I got mine from Aliexpress.

These are obviously designed for the Schneider Gelion + refills. Using these refills, there is absolutely no tip wobble, which is extremely rare for a plastic pen. If you use another brand of Parker G2 refill, you will likely get a tiny bit of tip wobble.

There is no text on the body of the pen showing the tip size or the color, so you can put any refill into it without it being awkward.

Dimensions:

* 132mm long
* Roughly 10mm diameter at the grip, but the grip section is rounded triangular.
* Mass: under 20 grams

The overall build is extremely solid, as you'd expect from a German product. There is no rattle, no looseness. It's all plastic and the plastic feels solid as well, not bendy or ""crispy"". It reminds me of the Zebra BLEN, but it doesn't have a silicone grip section.

The clip is solid, but flexible.

Click is similar to other plastic clickers. Not too loud, not silent either. Feels high quality.

Balance is perfectly in the middle.

\--

TLDR: Good cheap German pen for Parker G2 refills."

0,"Spend my money (alternatively, ""My next pen is...?"") I've recently started buying a buncha pens.  I hesitate to say I collect bc I have a bit of completionist in me and, well, there's no such thing as a completionist pen collector.

In any event, I have a preference for metal ballpoint click pens, preferably not round and smooth, and preferably not thin or light.  Have a look at what I've gathered and share any thoughts about what should come next.

My favorite refills so far are EasyFlow 9000, Monteverde p44 (fine, not a ballpoint) and Schneider Slider 755 XB.

My favorite pen so far is the ever-popular Rotring 600.  The enjoyable octagonal shape of the Kawecos got me thinking that maybe more sides are better, which led me to the dodecahedral HMM ballpoint, which I don't really like much at all.  It's too close to round-and-smooth. You'll notice a Jotter XL in there, which is definitely round and smooth (not to mention too tapered for me), but I dig the click and the aesthetic so I'm happy to have it (in gray, no matter how blue the pic looks).

The surprise to me is the Ohto GS01 - love the click and its subtle non-roundness so much that an orange one should be arriving for me today.  I'm also surprised by how poorly the coating on the GS02 has held up.

Not pictured is a Zebra F701, whose subpar click and native refill, as well as easily-wonked clip, leave it out of my rotation - I do use all these pens in the office.

I haven't been able to find my perfect pen.  I wonder if something like a Loclen W3/W5 would be as close as I could get even tho it doesn't click.

Any thoughts are appreciated - this is all very new to me.  Thank you.

For those who like Tul gel pens - I stopped by one of my local Office Depots to browse this morning and I notice that the price for a 2-pack of Tul gel refills seemed lower than usual ($1.89 for 2). So I checked online and sure enough the in-store price is 1/2 the online price; don‚Äôt know the reason for the price difference but I‚Äôm not going to complain üòÄ, so I picked up a few refills.

0,"Copic Multiliner SP 0.03mm Review A few days ago, I just bought my first product from Copic: the Copic Multiliner SP 0.03mm. I like writing small, so I got the thinnest one I could find. I appreciate the large ink capacity and the aluminum body. However, I cannot FUCKING stand how the barcode is printed on the BODY of the pen rather than being a peel-able sticker. Copic advertises the product as being usable for a lifetime with its replaceable ink and nib and yet decides to put the most annoying barcode on the body of the actual pen?! It infuriates me more than words can explain. But anyway, the ink flow is smooth and it‚Äôs a pretty good black color. I rate it an 8/10."
0,"Looking for Pentel Energel Crimson Black and Charcoal Black 0.7 Refill Recently bought the 24 color set of the Kuro Energels. I LOVE the shades of black and ran through the Bordeaux Black in 2 days.

I know that these are a variation(?) on some of the limited edition colors released in 2021\*. I managed to track down refills for the Bordeaux Black and the Olive Black on Jet pens, but I am looking for the other two. Any leads on these would be appreciated.

I understand that they may just not be available, so as another question, given that they are selling both the 24 set with these colors and the shades of black set in the north american market is it likely that we will see these refills in the future?

As a total aside: I am so annoyed that they didn't include the indigo black. I know that it is VERY close to the navy black, but I would have taken 25 colors happily lol.

0,"Pigma Micron PN Review A week ago, I picked up the Pigma Micron PN in black and blue colors. Previously, I bought the 005 version of the normal Pigma Micron. However, the PN version has been a much better experience for me. Now, I‚Äôm not much of an artist, so maybe the normal Micron is better for art. However, the PN provides such a smooth and enjoyable writing experience and I‚Äôve absolutely loved it so far. I hope it has a good ink capacity though because there‚Äôs no way to check how much ink is left and it isn‚Äôt refillable. I prefer pens that allow refills, even if the company doesn‚Äôt have an official ink refill, because I collect pens and don‚Äôt enjoy throwing them out. So, I rate it an 8.5/10."

0,"I hate that EnerGel is so good... EnerGel is considered by many, including myself, to be the best gel ink out there, and thus the best ink for writing on normal paper (cause nothing beats gel on paper).

But because it is so good, everything else feels 2nd best. And that's a real problem because there are no Parker G2 refills with EnerGel ink, and the normal EnerGel refills don't fit well into the fancy machined pens that are designed for the Pilot G2. The EnerGel tip is 0.3mm narrower in diameter, so there's a lot of tip wobble when you use them in a Pilot G2 pen. I know most people aren't bothered by this wobble, but I have severe OCD with stuff like this.

There's only a few machined pens out there that take EnerGel: Big Idea Designs (cause those pens can take all refills) and Autmog (he made a few models for EnerGel). I really, really wish more folks would make machined pens for EnerGel..."

0,"Some Parker Refill Writing Samples What started as a comparison between the Power Tank and Jetstream SXR-600 turned into a sample of every Rotring-600 compatible cartridge I have. Seen some discussion about this pen and refill format, so figured I'd share.

The Jetstream is easily my favorite, just wish it had a blue option. The power tank is noticably thinner and has a bit more drag, like a traditional ballpoint. Still a great option for a pressurized pen.

The EF9000 is TOO slick for me, I just don't find it comfortable to write with. The Jetstream has just a touch more feedback and is perfect.

The Monteverde and Schmidt P900 are both a step up from other ballpoints I've used,  but not up there with the hybrid inks. I prefer the Monteverde of the two.

Parker Gel is.... Fine. It feels like a generic gel it's just not my preference.

Rotring stock refill is booty.

Paper is just random scrap printer paper.

Note: the power tank is the standard plastic version, not the Fisher shaped SJP-7. I expect the performance to be similar."

0,"A few words on the Everyman Grafton EDC(?) pen Overall, it's a great pen that writes smooth. The option of swapping the inksert is a great idea, however execution left a little to be desired with this pen.
Starting with the ink, when using a Pilot G2 compared to their proprietary inksert, I've noticed the blue pen has play in it. Nothing substantial and this isn't an issue, however I've noticed this makes the lines a little wobbly if you're trying for straight lines. Not a deal breaker to a majority of people, especially their target base.
Moving towards the top of the pen, I've noticed that simply picking up and setting down the pen makes the grip start to loosen. Once again, not a major issue as long as it doesn't come apart before you catch it. They don't sell the hardware separately, so it's SOL if you lose the inner bits (a spring and spacer that's removed for certain inkserts). I put some blue locktite on the silver pen, and that seems to have fixed the issue. 
The pocket clip is great, it's smooth so insertion is easy with one hand. But the coating/paint on it comes off easily. So easily that just rolling around a desk flakes it off, exposing the brass beneath. Kind of a neat look, gives it a patina type of feel. But it loses professional looks.
The body is all 6061-T, so it does bend and compress rather easily. My silver pen stays in my pocket all day, and as you can tell I've dropped it a few times. About 3 feet onto concrete. Not a big deal, but it creates burrs that will need to be filed to avoid tearing pants or skin. I think a steel tip or even just a steel ring at the very tip brazed in would be a nice upgrade to avoid this.
Overall, as stated above, really great pen. Been using the pair of these pens for almost a year daily in a warehouse setting, and they hold up pretty well, for the most part. However, if using in rough/less than desirable conditions, be prepared for a pen that looks used. It feels good in the hand, it's got a good girth to it for us larger fingered folk. After skepticism towards the goofy cuts used as ""grips"", they actually do quite well, even with oily gloves on. Would buy again, if on sale, and in a healthier environment."

0,"Need some help cleaning leaked ink without (Further) damaging pen Hello, I received a Mont Blanc ballpoint pen as a birthday present a few years back, and I have kept in in storage ever since. Yesterday, I decided I would start to use it and I realised that the pen had leaked, the ink sort of ""solidified"", you know how a blot of dried ink gets sticky.  I have tried cleaning the pen with IPA, and I realise this was a mistake as I think that has ruined the finish of the pen (Originally turned white, but some rubbing got it back to blue), picture below, but that's beside the point. (I have only done this to the front plastic part of the pen, the back part with the clip is fine.)

Despite soaking the pen in water for an hour and getting most of the ink out, I think there is still some ink at the tip that I do not have any tools to reach as the spring does not seem to be removable. Does anyone know of any way to get rid of the excess ink still inside the pen? Thanks in advance!

I have no idea what the model of the pen is, an the service manual on showed how to change a refill for the pen.

0,"A pressurized Parker G2 refill that actually writes well: Schmidt MegaLine &amp;#x200B;

[You can get them on Amazon, but they're not cheap...](https://preview.redd.it/4312vloxgtpc1.png?width=1831&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=372de9b67be3de277c57bcca466676399afa53f1)

We all know and have tried the Fisher refills. They work... but the ink technology is outdated to say the least. 

Schmidt has an alternative that's better in every way.

1. Bigger ink volume
2. Darker, more saturated color
3. Less skipping, especially on high-end paper with low absorbency 
4. Smoother, ink flows easier in general

The downside is that it's more expensive per refill (though it's probably cheaper if you considered the volume of ink you're getting.

Also, unlike the Fisher, you can't fit these into a Zebra F-701. While most Parker G2s will fit into the F-701 if you remove the cap, the MegaLine is a pressurized refill, so I don't recommend removing the cap for obvious reasons.

\--

Compared to non-pressurized, oil-based refills like the Parker QuinkFlow, the EasyFlow 9000, and Jetstream, I'd say the performance is actually superior because there's much less skipping with the MegaLine. I think the pressurization helps.

The downside when compared to these common ballpoint refills is that you often get these little tiny blobs of ink that get burped out. A common problem will pressurized refills."

My beloved promotional pens cap will no longer stay seated. I had hoped to maybe find something more enduring, like a metal body, to hold the ink refills that I'd purchased. I've got like 50 of them.
So I decided to start, what may be a very long project, of just ""kit bashing"" my own. I think when one runs out I'll just make a new one.
First pic is from original post. Second is the first of many. I found an old Papermate Ink Joy, that no longer worked. Gutted it, trimmed the end of the new cart a bit. Took the protective tip, and trimmed it enough to fit around the cartridge, inside the empty barrel to keep the tip stable. Little dab of super glue, and there we go.
It makes my sustainable, foraging, recycling goblin brain happy."

I currently have one like [this](https://a.co/d/c2wnUPp) case (but it has four zipper‚Äôs instead of three, I cant find the same one but its a lot like this one). I absolutely love it but I haven‚Äôt had it long and it has already broken. 

When I was adding in a couple more pens I got I noticed that the stitching in the elastic band that connects it to the case was coming out in a lot of spots, and one spot it even came completely out. I want a case that is small like this (I don‚Äôt care if its thick, I just don‚Äôt want it big like a laptop case). 

I haven‚Äôt been able to find anything like this that has good reviews for pens, and I have looked for hours.

0,"What nonexisting pen variation do you, in your opinion, wish have existed? Okay the title is a little wonky, but hear me out. There are just some pens that we wished had a little more variation to the lineup. If this explanation isn't clear, then I'll give a few probably unnecessary examplex:

1A) Uni Ball One 0.3/0.28. Just because it's quite a thin boi if u think about it, but I understand if it hasn't really gotten high up into the list of suggestions at Uni since it's pretty much for a niche audience and picky people with small handwriting like me, plus there may be some incompatibilities with the ink (it might be too thick for the tip but I'm also not sure since the thinner tip sizes work better from experience).

1B) ...fika colors for the style fit

2) More realistic one's probably a dual-tipped version of the Kuretake Zig Clean Color Dot Markers in the smoky color set. It might be in the works since the other sets do have a dot and a dual-tipped version, respectively.

3) More muted color sets for the Papemate Flair.

I have some sensory issues so if I don‚Äôt like the way a pen feels to hold or write with I won‚Äôt ever touch it again, needless to say I‚Äôm at my wits end :‚Äù)) some things that might help point me to the pen(s) of my dreams:

- I only ever use ballpoint, I‚Äôm open to hybrid but I like the way the ink comes out 

- There are only 2 pens I‚Äôve found so far that are perfect for me, these are the Pilot B2P ballpoint 0.7mm fine tip (sadly very hard to come by, I had to bulk buy on eBay. I tried the medium tip but it didn‚Äôt feel the same sadly) and the Paper Mate Flexgrip Ultra 1mm (writes surprisingly thin but comes in only the standard colours).

- I prefer ballpoints that write thin, and as I‚Äôm a cursive writer I like a pen that‚Äôs nimble but with a bit of drag. 

- I don‚Äôt even mind if there aren‚Äôt that many colour options, as long as it comes in a dark green I‚Äôm happy (I colour code my notes for university and I‚Äôm missing green for languages!)

-I would like a pen that has a grip or groove so that it feels comfortable to write with

-I have a preference for clicky pens but that‚Äôs not a must!!!! Caps and twists are totally fine too :)

- If there are any swatches online of how the pen writes please link it in the reply if that‚Äôs not too much trouble, I find I can tell off the bat that a pen isn‚Äôt my cup of tea if I can see what it looks like in writing

The Sarasa Zebras have been a God send for me and my note taking. They are unbelievably smooth and don't smear at all. I never liked 0.5 but figured I get the Zebra a chance and I'll tell you, it's changed my mind. The Zebra pens give elegance to your writing mistakes.

Pros of Zebra 0.7&amp;0.5: 
-Extremely smooth 
-Almost no smudge/bleed
-Fun to use 

Cons:
-Pricey (~$1.30 per pen)
-Refills about the same
-Have to ship from Japan (I live in US) 

The Sharpie S Gel (Metal Barrel) is a close substitute for me when I am either low on Sarasa pens or don't have my pen case with me and don't want to risk losing my Sarasa. They are relatively cheap pens that I can pick up at my local Target and aren't a day ruiner if lost. 

Pros:
-Mostly Smooth writing 
-Easy to get
-Reliable 
-Good and heavy for pen spinning

Cons:
-Some Smudge/Bleed
-Never get it back if lent to someone
-not always consistent

I have tried the uniball gel after seeing it all over here and while definitely a nice pen, I'm not sure if it exactly fit my likings. Also, G2s, I used to very much enjoy, then found the Sarasa Zebras.... I haven't used one in almost a year now.

0,"Looking for a nice(r) pen with a low grip I use a lateral quadrupod grip when writing and hold my pens quite close to the tip. Usually, there's about 1cm between the tip of the pen and where my ring finger rests. 

There are a handful of lightweight, plastic-bodied pens that have comfortable low grips that I've tried, including:

* Pentel Energel RTX
* Zebra Sarasa Clip
* Zebra bLen

Now that I'm interested in a nicer, potentially metal pen, I know I'm going to be increasing the weight and therefore the pressure on my ring finger when writing. I want to make sure that the pens I try have a low enough grip to minimize that finger pain, but it's very hard to tell which pens will work from online pictures and descriptions.

Other requirements:

* Refills: I really like the Uni Jetstream ink in .38 and .5, pentel energel in .5 needle tip, and the zebra sarasa in .4 and .5. Ideally, this pen would accept at least one of these options.
* Retractable is a must. Don't care if it's click or twist, but I will absolutely lose a cap. 
* I'm not dead set on metal, I'm just looking for something nicer than the standard issue ""disposable"" $2-3 options out there.
* Open to a multi-pen, but not a requirement.
* I'd like to keep it under $50.

I got a batch of them on Aliexpress the other day and I noticed that they would not fit into my Machine Era TEK because the tip was slightly too wide. However, this is actually a GOOD thing because Machine Era pens have just ***barely*** enough of an opening for the Parker G2. The vast majority of other Parker G2 pens have tip wobble.

0,"Zebra Sarasa Clip Arabesque Edition My first post here. 

I celebrate Ramadan where I live, so just for culture context reasons, I thought to post these beautiful Zebra Sarasa Clip Arabesque edition gel pens. These write very beautifully as their reputation tells of them. And the elaborate geometric patterns are very lovely. Every color has its own distinct pattern on the clip and barrel. The color is rich too! The package says these are ""Limited Edition"", but not sure if it's limited in a time sense, region sense, or what exactly. Can't find these in Zebra's site either. (All the more reason to share these). 

Anyhow, wanted to share these pens. I love them and gladly picked up a second pack.

0,"Kaweco rollerball that takes international short cartridges? Hey folks,   


I've been doing a bit of sleuthing to see if Kaweco makes their steel/metal sport rollerball pens in a style that takes international cartridges (in a similar fashion to their fountain pens). So far, I've found a couple of alternatives from [travelers-company.com](https://travelers-company.com) and [machine-era.com](https://machine-era.com); but I really love the Kaweco.

I'm wondering if anyone could give me a lead on some options from something similar to any ways to modify the pen to take an 07 refillable kit of some sort.

0,"Hotel use Pen recommendation So I work at a hotel, so my pen use is abit odd. I am trying to find a good brand of pen to use on the cardstock key sleeves, but because they're semi-laminated, I have to avoid gel pens. I have been using some inexpensive Pentel ballpoint pens until now, but I'm looking into nicer brands that might last abit longer(my partner also uses the same style for her work, so mine mysteriously vanish when I'm not looking).

I used to be fond of Zebra pens, especially the steel bodied ones, however they weren't the most comfortable to use for long. The other main feature I need is a clip, since I don't have a breast pocket, I usually use the clip to put the pen on my shirt, where the buttons are on the work polos I wear, so a retractable pen with a sturdy clip is a great feature I'm having trouble finding. I did find a brand on Amazon ([Fengtaiyuan](https://a.co/d/iMNxIdK)) that might have a more sturdy clip design, but as I've never used them, I could use some feedback on how sturdy they'd actually be.

If anyone has feedback about these pens, or others in regards to my kindof specific use-case, I'd love to get some recommendations."

Parker Jotter - I want to like this one more but the tapered end is too severe and my fingers slide down towards the tip as I‚Äôm writing. Goes from thick to narrow pretty quickly so it feels weird in my grip.

I'm new to this community, just stopping by to ask for pen recommendations for someone who writes very sideways. I hold my pens very high up and the tip hits the page at a very low angle, so not straight up and down. Some pens handle this better than others, but I usually find myself scratching the page with the part of the ball-point pen that holds the ball, if that makes sense.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm completely unaware if this is an issue that others have run into. I've never went down the fountain pen rabbit hole, as I've mostly used cheaper ball-point pens. Any recommendations are welcome!  


(Note, I'm not sure if it's an issue with fountain pens, but I feel like I've heard with those that you have to drag the pen, not push it. I'm not looking for calligraphy, I'm a math major and I write fast, I'd like something versatile!)

Loaded the pen with a fisher space cartridge, not a fan of the feel of writing particularly, but this will be heavily used for utility etc.

It looks almost identical to the original 600 design, just a little shorter, and the stamped logo on the clip isn't as defined.  Otherwise, my only complaint is that the button feels cheap.  I pictured my Monami 153 above which preciously held the space cartridge.  That button is way nicer.  The rotring button has a lot of play and scraps the sides loudly as you press it down.  Added a drop of oil and pressed it a couple hundred times (I fidget a lot with pens) and it feels a little better.  If you let it spring back up on its own it jams though :(.

Then I found this sub and fell in love with pens like Rotring 600, Zebra F701 etc that are heavy and come with a good grip. But what keeps me from getting them is that they can't take signo refills. I like jetstream refills but I don't like how ballpoint inks look on page. 

Therefore, I sorted out 2 uniball pens that are similar. Uniball jetstream edge and Jetstream alpha gel. Kindly help me out with these queries.

1. Do they take uni signo refills?

2. Are there any alternatives that might be better than or similar to them or rotring 600 and take signo refills?

0,"I need Oil-Based Ballpoint reccomendations.  So I have exams coming up and I was told to use a ballpoint pen and no gel pens. The reason is that oilbased ballpoints are safer when papers are scanned in industrial scanners because supposedly gel pen ink runs off or something.
I usually use a Uniball Signo 207 or a Uniball ClickGel which are both gel-pens.
The rubber grip is comfortable, the overall thickness of the pen is ergonomics for me because I have a quite large hand and because they have just the right about of friction for my handwriting. Also they're retractable and the ink doesn't get in my hands.
Can someone please suggest me a similar ballpoint pen? I went to the local stationery shop and they gave me a Uniball Jetsteam SXN-210 but it's toooo smooth for me and because I am told that it's a rollerball pen with liquid ink that can cause the same problem.

Pentel energel (conical tip) - it‚Äôs a good pen and doesn‚Äôt smudge much although if you tend to use a lot of pens at the same time then it will dry up fairly quickly / it is very smooth and reliable

Zebra sarasa - this is the darkest and smoothest pen out of these / as long as you don‚Äôt care about smudging too much you NEED THIS PEN

Sharpie s-gel - this pen is certainly unique and I think that you should only buy it once you have tried them out however they are smudge resistant

\- Low flow but consistent

\- Blue

\- Clicker (using a capped pen is literally just asking to lose it in the environment I'm in)

I think from the side thing that it's a bladder fill but I could be wrong as I know nothing about this other than whose it was.

Any info would be appreciated"

1,"NPD/NID: Narwhal/Nahvalur Schuylkill Fine in Dragonet Sapphire with Diamine Writer's Blood. Had the itch for a new pen and landed on this one, felt like picking up some new ink as well (first time trying Diamine) and rounded it out with a new Leuchtturm1917 notebook. I have it inked up but it just came in yesterday, looking forward to seeing how I like it. Heard pretty decent things online and liked the color treatment on the resin, and picked the ink to compliment. 

Outside of writing, the online pictures don't do the resin treatment justice, the layering/depth as I would describe it are very pleasing to look at and spin the pen in my fingers, the pockets of shimmer give it a lot of pop too. 

Ordered from Atlas Stationers originally, they unfortunately had to cancel the pen shipment as it wasn't in stock and the other nib options weren't what I was looking for. The ink and notebook showed up quickly though. 

However, shoutout to Pen Chalet. Ordered from them to get the pen and they had it packed and marked to ship within like 3 hours of ordering, was very pleasantly surprised. "

1,"What is this pen? Conway Stuart 58 or not? (And other questions) Hi everyone! 

This is a pen in my local antiques store, I‚Äôve pretty much purchased every fountain pen they had apart from a Parker 61, a ‚Äúunique fountain pen‚Äù, 2 Queensway pens, an Osmiroid 65 and this mystery pen I‚Äôm enquiring about. (If you think any of the pens I haven‚Äôt bought thus far are worth getting then do let me know!)

I really want to know what is this pen? Is it a Conway Stuart 58 like the label says or something else? From my research the 58 had 3 thin cap bands but this one has a single medium one and from looking at a list of Conway Stuart pens I can‚Äôt quite see any that look similar. Maybe it‚Äôs a frenkenpen? 

Additionally the last 2 photos show 2 pens I can‚Äôt find anything at all about but I think they look very pretty and nice, I may just get those regardless because they are so cheap, but I thought I‚Äôd ask whilst I‚Äôm here what people think these are?"

1,"Why does TWSBI require more maintenance? I have a Pelikan M215 that‚Äôs 8 years old and have never done any maintenance on it apart from flushing with distilled water during ink changes. No issues even if left without writing for long periods like 6 months. The piston mechanism works really well.Same case with Lamy 2000 which I‚Äôve had for 2 years.

The TWSBI eco and 580 are a whole different story. They write extremely well, but in the 3 years I‚Äôve owned them, the piston gets stuck more often and it requires disassembly, cleaning, greasing say once every 3-4 months, otherwise the top part of the piston gets stuck and separated from the piston rod. I find TWSBI piston pens more fiddly. Is this expected or did I just get unlucky with TWSBI? "

1,"Update to last week‚Äôs post gushing about the Majohn A2‚Ä¶. I fell in love with my capless A2 and wanted to know if a Pilot Vanishing Point was worth the extra money as an upgrade.

I found a special alloy (steel nib) pilot capless on Amazon Japan for ¬£60 delivered. The build quality and feel of the nib for writing is noticeably better. I am so pleased with my new pen - If you‚Äôre wondering about upgrading from your Majohn capless, go for it! 

The Pilot fine steel nib is comparable in line thickness to the Majohn A2 extra fine, which is how I hoped it would be. The new Pilot is going to be my work note taking pen, and I‚Äôll fill the A2 with orange ink for highlighting.

1,"New pen keeps cutting out  I have a  month old barely used Parker Vector XL with medium nib. Most of the time it writes beautifully...

1,"DIY Fountain Pen Ink Questions I'm an artist not a chemist so while I have been reading the reddit threads, the FPN threads, and some recipes on the topic-I have questions before I buy materials.

1. When you are making your own oil paint you can't buy oils that are food grade because they already have non drying preservatives in them but I see that there's a lot of people encouraging the use of food grade glycerin. My question is: Does it matter whether it is food grade or not? Is the glycerin sold by art companies Rublev just repackaged food grade glycerin (is it all food grade???)? Has anyone experimented with replacing it with a synthetic humectant in ink? 

2. Preservatives. I'm already aware that natural preservatives are not necessarily safer or better but I'm pretty freaked out by the idea of having something that off gasses formaldehyde in my house and likewise I don't want to spend money on a bag of citric acid if it doesn't actually preserve the ink. I've seen people recommend germall plus and also seen people use thyme oil. For me this is a necessity, I don't want to make something that's just going to become unusable in a week or two. Any recommendations?

3. Detergent as a surfactant, has anyone tried this? How does it go in the long term? Both Golden and Rublev sell their own 'wetting agents' for making paint and I'm assuming Vaness white lightening is basically the same thing. Curious about what people have tried.

4. Has anyone put gum arabic in a pen? This seems like a pretty bad idea since it's resinous(?), yeah? But it's very popular in the ink making youtube videos that want to use non toxic ingredients. I already have this so it'd be nice if it worked but I don't want to sacrifice a pen to it.

5. If anyone knows how Sailor achieves the dual shading effect please break NDA for me.

Thank you!"

I‚Äôve been getting paper from Franklin-Christoph for a while, but haven‚Äôt yet touched any of their pens or nibs. 

I‚Äôve been looking at the SIG nibs, but am caught between Fine or Medium. When I first got into fountain pens, I was enthused about Extra Fines, since it was my preference in regular pens, but have settled more towards a regular Fine. However, for a nib specifically designed for variation, it seems like it might be more fun to get it in a nib size that would show it off a little more. 

I‚Äôm a lefty, so I would like comfort at the various contorted angles my overhook demands, but I also love shading. 

I just wanted to ask if you guys had a preference between the sizes, and how the feedback feels. I have a few pens that take #6 nibs if there are also some fun nib options that I might not know about from other people. 

Thanks!"

Pens:

* There appears to be an ""official store"", however, it's range is somewhat more limited than in other stores, paricularly when it comes to nib offerings.  The price points are about the same between stores - do you all tend to stick to the official store?  Is there something weird about these other stores?

Nibs:

* The ""official store"" seems to have mostly just E and F with an occasional ""blade"", whereas other stores have a much wider range; EF, F, M, Long Knife, bending, normal/hand polished.  The hand polished thing in particular is confusing me, they are slightly more expensive and I'm wondering what the difference is.  Have any of you tried these different nibs?  I'm wondering if the hand polished perhaps have a bit more flex or smoothness to them.

Final question - Writing style:

* Are there any of you that are ""scrappy writers"" as opposed to using a slower more methodical (calligraphy type) style?  I use my pens as daily drivers and my writing can get really messy if I'm trying to get down some of my random ADHD induced brain vomit.  If so, which style nibs do you find works best for you?  I'm kind curious about the blade style of nib but I'm unsure if it will work well with scrawl.

1,"Parker Slimfold c 1968/69? I won an Ebay auction on Monday for a Parker Slimfold; it arrived today and it's in beautiful working condition. The nib is medium, 14kt - its actually my first ever gold-nib pen. Guys, the hype is real. It's buttery smooth. 

Tried and failed to take some good photos so I'll just show you the ones supplied by the seller.

The seller said it was ""1960s"", based on the nib I'm pretty sure I can narrow it down to 1968 or 1969. This pen is very nearly (but not quite) as old as I am. The rubber ink sac looks good, I suspect that's been replaced at some point in the pen's history.

This is my second vintage Parker (I have a 25 from c 1983).  And I think I may have just found my niche in the FP world.  I won't tell you exactly how much I paid for this, but suffice to say, any cheaper would have been practically theft.

I‚Äòm a noob to fountain pens and recently decided to dive into the hobby, so I bought a nice looking pen off of Etsy. There are probably much better ways of finding a great pen, but I just fell in love with this one. There is only one problem: now that it arrived, I realise I don‚Äôt like the feel of the nib. It‚Äôs way too hard and I need to press down quite a bit to get a nice and thick line.

I decided I want to look for a new nib, here is where I need some help from you all. Can you identify the size/model of this nib and where I can buy a nib that will also fit my pen? I contacted the seller already, but they didn‚Äôt have any information for me sadly.

These are the measurements I took from the nib and its housing:
Diameter of housing: ~6,5mm
Diameter of thicker housing-ring: ~8mm
Length of housing (with ring): ~24,5mm
Visible length of nib: ~16,5mm
Entire length of housing and nib: ~41mm

In the pictures the text on the nib isn‚Äôt very readable, so here is what it says. On the top of the nib it says ‚ÄûIridium Point Germany‚Äú and on the bottom of the nib, stamped into the plastic it says ‚Äû5‚Äú

For comparison, the squares of the paper I took the pictures on are 5mm big (just in case this kind of paper isn‚Äôt common outside of the EU).

I'm in need of recommendations for my next pen. I'm an avid lover of Lamy Safari's (EF, and M) and TWSBI Eco's but I kind of want to upgrade! I own a Conklin duragraph, which I don't really love honestly, but it came in a mystery box so I begrudgingly keep it haha. I have one Kaweco Sport, I like the size, though I don't particularly enjoy the EF nib on it...

A couple pens I've been eyeing are the Pilot Vanishing Point specifically black matte or white/black), and a Sailor Pro Gear Slim (Dragon Palace or Grateful Crane)... So probably a top budget of $250 USD. I live closest to Goulet Pens but I don't mind ordering else where! I typically use my pens for light journaling or leisure writing, nothing crazy! Also any recommendations for accessories is welcome too! I journal in a Hobonichi Techo and a Leuchtturm 1917 most often.

It's version 2 of the Discoball I made on a Majohn Q1 base (at the time with cashew lacquer). Several changes to the approach the 2nd time were cutting the raden into much smaller pieces than before to get a smoother transition over the surface of the pen, and rotating each piece of raden on the surface so that it would reflect the light when viewed at the correct angle. 

I love the end result but the process of getting there is definitely a test of patience üôà That being said I want to still try this again using different type of shells to see what effect it would give. I just need to take another year before I'm ready to do that again haha."

Well, a couple of weeks ago my resin pocket pen started getting cracks (any guesses which brand?). I decided to find a replacement pocket pen made out of metal. A lot of people recommend various metal versions of the Kaweco Sport and I opened my mind a bit. Ultimately I decided to try the much cheaper Hongdian M2. I liked it a lot, fantastic pen for $20.

But the other day, I happened to notice that the Kaweco Brass Sport was on sale with fine nib for $50, so I just bit the bullet and ordered one. I've been carrying it for one day so far and... I absolutely love it. It's so well-built. It's so hefty and heavy and solid feeling. It feels like an indestructible tool. The nib isn't a gusher, but that's probably ideal for a pocket pen since I will be often using it on less-than-great paper. It's a smooth writer. It's weirdly comfortable for an ~~hexagonal~~ octagonal pen. It just feels like quality.

I'm a convert. And yes, I like it even more than the M2, though I'll probably be rotating them both out for EDC pens since they're both really nice."

Previously I complained about how much broader the broad was and while I still wait for my cartridge in that to run out to try a drier ink, I have hit upon a realization with the unique nib feedback that Sailor nibs are supposed to offer...  


**The Problem**   
So my Fine nib on the Profit was super dry, extra-toothy and just not much fun to write with. Reading up on several posts on multiple platforms, the general consensus on Sailor fine and extra-fine nibs seemed to be that they will be very toothy... and you just have to learn to appreciate that or just get another pen. But others have also mentioned about this so-called pencil-like feedback Sailor nibs tend to have. 

Now, my broad nib was ultra smooth, but it had a hint of feedback to it quite unlike my other two Western broad nibs. Completely different from the toothy unfriendly feedback the fine nib was giving me... any more pressure than feather touch and it starts dragging on the page. Mind you, it was feedback and not scratchiness. The nib wasn't catching on the paper, it was same in all directions so I don't believe I got misaligned tines (even though I don't have a loupe to confirm). 

I got myself a hold of a pencil (it has been ages since I wrote with one) and realized the Broad nib was much closer in feedback to that pencil than the fine nib ever was...

I resisted for several days but eventually caved in and took to smoothening it out using the nail-filer hack, using the different grits to get to a point where it felt smoother on paper.   


**End result**

The nib writes a slightly thicker line, one that I would consider a proper fine line (I believe it is somewhere between 0.3 to 0.35ish, based on my other nibs). It writes much smoother now. But lo and behold, it now has the same characteristic feedback that the broad nib offers. They are slightly different, but that is probably down to the width difference and me doing the smoothening by trial and error.   


The nib in its current form is vastly superior to what I got out of the box. Comparison with the Sailor broad I have, and my experience with a pencil, this is what I should have gotten out of the box.   


**Conclusion**

The only conclusion I can draw from this is that my nib was under-polished. Based on how some people complain about their fine Sailor nibs on several forums, I strongly believe that too suffer from under-polished nibs. In some cases, they are being told that that is just how Sailor nibs are supposed to be, when I am quite confident that is not the case. The feedback now is pencil-like. The writing wonderfully smooth. It has now become a pen I cherish.   


**Disclaimer**  
DYI smoothening can be risky and you may end up destroying your nib (even though I have been lucky  thus far). If your pen is still in warranty and it is easier to send it back, it may be worth a punt to get yours checked up by Sailor.

Long story short, here is my first fountain pen:

Franklin-Christoph Model 02 Intrinsic - Antique Glass &amp; Cathedral SE

Nibs I bought: 1.9C Music Polished and Flex Extra-Fine

I understand FP and FP music nibs are not necessary for music notation. They might not even be ideal for that purpose. I bought that nib for fun anyway.

What I like: 3 ways to fill ink - standard international long/short cartridge, converter, eyedropper; the acrylic body that looks like a Coke bottle, combined with the ""cathedral"" pattern; smooth nibs and the nib choices. I have learned how to use the first two types of filling mechanism. I will try the eyedropper when I feel ready.

I do not particularly like Model 02's tapered shape, bigger size, the clip and the deep post. But I do like the Aantique Glass and Cathedral style that is only available in this model. My first choice was Model 46 XLVI in Antique Glass. Both styles were out of stock. So, I came to a stop after days of looking. Thinking I was at least saving money. Then in less than 12 hours after I signed up for notification, Model 02 in the color I wanted was back in stock again. I ordered quickly. (The other style is now also in stock two weeks later.)

My F-C package arrived on the same day as two other packages of items I grabbed from my first fountain pen haul. I am so happy.

1,"A Homage to the Pilot Varsity About 6 years ago I came to love fountain pens again. Again, as I had used them in school throughout my life, having always been left unsatisfyed by the way these school pens like the Lamy Safari performed (yes, the QC on Lamy steel nibs is terrible, we all know it, let's not kid ourselves). I came to love them again because I discovered a new side to them: Piston fillers, ink bottles, golden nibs writing buttery smooth, differen nib grinds and a plethora of unique brands from all over the world. 

Yet I also looked at the different side of fountain pens. The Platinum Preppy always fascinated me; an eyedropper with a solid nib and good construction for under 10 bucks. But there was another pen I couldn't really get out of my mind. The Pilot Varsity, or VPen. A non-reusable fountain pen; a mass-produced oxymoron. Isn't it in the nature of fountain pens to be reused? Don't we pride ourselves in thinking our pens may be used for generations to come? And in addition: Isn't it exciting to modify our experience with them through different new nib grinds, unique inks and the like? And here is a piece of plastic that shouldn't be reused, shouldn't be reground (because why would you?) and, technically, can't even be refilled with different inks. A car that can't drive, a plane that can't fly, emergency staircases with attributes such as ""well-flammable"" and ""easy-to-break"" come to mind. Yet it made me happy to imagine a pen that wrote well at that price. Fast forward more than 5 years, the Varsity remained in my Amazon wishlist until today.

I bought a pack of 2 Varsitys online for 8 Euros. I remember very clearly that their price was about 7 Euros 5 years ago as well (a very SUSTAINABLE price for a non reusable pen imo). They came in today and I ripped one out of it's plastic cocoon.

It wrote immediately. My Pelikans didn't do that. My Lamy 2k hardstarted. My Platinum 3776 did write immediately too, but did so too thinly for me to even get to enjoy it. This thing wrote immediately. It has royal blue ink, I hate royal blue inks, filled inside its body, but I do like this ink. It is bold and saturated, unlike inks from Lamy, Waterman, really any brand that makes these ""washable"" royal blues. Its nib is steel, but it is tipped quite well. And it writes perfectly. I don't like to use the word perfect a lot, I wouldn't use it talking about my Pelikans, Lamys, Platinums etc. But I use it here. It writes perfectly. 

Why is a disposable pen miles better than anything I got my hands on these past 5 years? Why did a perfect fountain pen, technically 2, sit in my wishlist all these years, two falcons in a cage, waiting to be released? I love this pen. I love it so much that I hate it. It shouldn't be this good. It can technically even be refilled with a nifty trick to get its feed out. I will use these pens dry now, and I might sell my Pelikan."

1,"Herbin Bleu Myosotis Hi - I'm new to this subreddit but not to fountain pens.

I've been wanting a 'soft' blue ink which I can use at work without ever raising any eyebrows, but which will also look 'beautiful'/interesting to my own eye.

I've used Diamine Prussian Blue for years, but I'm starting to find I'm sick of the sight of it and would like something a bit... more 'cheerful'/ less 'dull'.

From what I've seen online (including in this sub), Herbin Bleu Mysosotis looks lovely - a blue that has a 'softness' and 'prettiness' and a bit of 'cheerfulness' without screaming ""Hey, I'm a self-indulgently weird ink colour being used by an overly whimsical woman in a very traditional, 'grown-up', professional environment!"".

I'm in the UK, and Herbin inks are not especially expensive here (and I love their Perle Noire and their Rose Cyclamen, both of which I use at home).

But before buying, I just wanted to ask about the only hesitation I have: I keep reading that Bleu Myosotis fades over time, and I'm wondering: is that a progressive thing (so that after one week it's a bit faded and after one year it's just like ghost-ink), or is it a 'finite' process (so that e.g. after one year or five years it is no more faded than it is after one week)?

Thanks in anticipation."

It's fairly obvious that the number of inks available is... extensive, however I've been having a particular problem regarding narrowing down inks.  I use my pens for note taking so shimmer/sheen is definitely out - as pretty as they are there's no way I could speed-read anything like that.  I like the idea of shading inks to inject a bit of personality however....

...how the heck do I figure out which inks are shading inks (or even plain) without having to look up each individual ink on google images and hoping for the best?  I've been browsing cult pens and sometimes they will indicate if an ink is shimmer/sheen, but other times they won't.  Inks tend to fall under manufacturer name only and if there are drop down menus then all bets are off.  Most swatches I see are flat swatches which often don't show sheen.

Stilo &amp; Scribe has been the most useful site so far, they allow you to filter out shimmer and their swatches are good enough for you to be able to see potential sheen *sometimes,* but it is still hard work trawling through them all &gt;.&lt;  So far I have found reviews the most useful, but trawling reviews is exhausting lol.

I am not planning to have a huge collection. I have a query on my Lamy. The original nib, a Medium, tends to skip on first strokes when I write either a vertical or oblique line. The horizontal line from right to left fell scratchy. Anyhow, I bought an EF. All good. The paper I mainly use at work is ok and cause no issues. However, notepads issued and little notebooks tend to cause the pen to dry and become scratchier. The cheap pilot on the other hand doesn't. In terms of ink, both are filled with a cheap Waterman intense black. As I don't think I can refill the pilot V for long, I have ordered a Kakuno. Any idea why my Lamy does this? Should I try a fine nib or is it quite sensitive to papers? If I use the notepads we get in the office, after probably half hour at most it completely stops and won't return to write. I had to disassemble and clean it twice in 2 weeks already. Just checking if that is normal or if Lamy is not the best choice for me then.

I'm looking to extend my modest fountain pen collection this year with an upgrade to my work carry - currently consisting of a TWSBI 580ALR EF running De Atramentis Document Black. Love the ink... but the pen doesn't make me the happiest, especially compared to some of my others.

My upgrade plan is for 2 fountain pens for note taking, a mechanical pencil for sketching ideas, and a ballpoint pen for the occasional times it's necessary.

I have a shortlist for the fountain pens and mechanical pencil\*, and I'm now here looking for ballpoint recommendations from fountain pen people. I'm looking for something classier than a Bic crystal (which I have a few of in my bag for giving to people who need to borrow a pen), and ideally reliable and comfortable to use. Budget has some flex but probably not breaking over $100/¬£100.

1,"Pelikan M1000 Problems  I bought this pen last week from Cultpens. I live here in Pennsylvania and it was delivered quickly arriving this morning and I love the pen. It looks good and feels good but it will not write well. 

It has difficulty starting.  It takes quite a few strokes or turning the nib over and writing to get it started and then it will only write for a few words and it stops again. The nib points have a visible gap between them all the way to the breather hole. When it does write, it gushes ink. So much that it pools up on the paper and the letters bleed together but again it is only for a few strokes. Oddly enough, it writes and starts great with the feed facing up and the nib facing down(upside down). 

I‚Äôve reached out to Cultpens for an exchange but they‚Äôre closed until Monday. I am hesitant to to do anything more than flush with warm water but is there anything else I could do aside from voiding the warranty?

1,"Majohn A1 ALWAYS dry starting suddenly. I bought a Majohn A1 probably about a year ago, been loving the pen, it very quickly became my primary pen and always wrote well even after the weekend of sitting not writing.  
But suddenly after a couple weeks of not using it due to a holiday it takes ages to get it started every time I use it, even if I only put it down for say 15min some times I just cant get it started. I don't know what to do or how to fix it any advice would be VERY appreciated as I have exams at the end of next month and kinda need this pen.

So far I've cleaned the pen its self through with warm water and let it soak. I replaced the ink as well. It's ink from the same pot I've been using for over a year and had no issues with it till now. Could it be the ink or is it the pen?

Quick disclaimer, I doubt the is the sort of place someone will tell me to use a biro for my exams in. Short answer is, I can't. Using a biro causes me a lot of discomfort due to past injury fountain pens don't and I need this pen as it's my finest nib which is very helpful for maths and physics."

1,"Nib/ink question I was recently gifted two fountain pens, and I liked them so much I went out and bought four more, lol. I haven't used two yet because I'm waiting on ink, but two of them came with cartridges and I figured I'd give them a go.

One is the Online ""Fluffy Cats"" pen with a medium nib. It is writing much thinner and scratchier than my new Lamy Safari, which also has a medium nib. I'm a bit disappointed - I know this is a relatively cheap pen, but I'm a cat person and read some good reviews of it before I bought it, and was expecting to like it. It's so cute, but I am not a fan of the thin writing or the scratchiness.

I am going to try cleaning it tomorrow and give it another shot, since I excitedly just popped the cartridge in and started writing (shame on me, I know). 

If that doesn't help, though, would getting a converter and a wetter ink at least result in thicker lines? Or is this more likely a nib issue? It was labeled as a medium nib (including on the sticker that came on the pen), and to my very inexperienced eye it does look about the same size as the nib on my Safari. I've tried it on a few different types of paper, and it doesn't seem to be a paper issue."

1,"What should I get next? Gotta be a Pilot or Sailor. Too long?: Pilots over $100(no VP...decimo tho! or Sailors.

I used to buy a lot of pens. Not as much as many of you but certainly not than I needed. In the 30 pen range. Mostly pens under $100. I was looking for my perfect pen. See, I buy a lot of stuff but I never see myself as a a collector. Just looking for that perfect thing. I landed on the Pilot Vanishing Point. I love it. It's my perfect pen. I gave most of my other pens away after I started using it.

But I have bad luck with them. My first I looked away for 30 seconds and my toddler daughter got ahold and the tines were doing splits when I went to write. I got a replacement nib. Lost the whole unit. And then I finished Uni and started drinking more. I've lost... Five. 

Ok, I've stopped drinking but I still lose things like crazy. ESPECIALLY pens. In 10 years I've lost... literally 50k worth of things. (Bracelets, phones, tablets, rings, etc.) Anyway, I have a VP at a nibsmith right now. But I wanna buy something to pass the time. Never had a Sailor. Looks pretty. I have everything from pilot under $100 2x. I'm retired. I have smallish hands. I don't write well and I write rather small.

I got a nib + feed from a Custom Urushi, but without a body. Is there any pen body that can hold it, ideally without specialized parts?

0,"DEFF Smart Refill Pen Jacket It‚Äôs around 50USD for the aluminum version, 100USD for the titanium version.

The pen holder is balanced dead center with the cap posted. Without the cap the pen is front heavy because the front part of the pen is stainless steel. Only the green parts of the pen is made of aluminum. I suspect the titanium version to be back heavy because of this.

 It works with basically any type refill except things like the Tombow Zoom refill, Uni Vision Elite, Pentel MGN6S. The length of the refill doesn‚Äôt really matter, the girth around tip is what decides if it will work or not. In actuality the Tombow Zoom can work if you‚Äôre committed. If you twist the metal inner portion that holds the refill you can actually strip the plastic around the Tombow refill until it fits perfectly. Here‚Äôs a random list of refills I‚Äôve tried. Every single one of them works.

Pilot BRFN-10M
Pilot Hi-Tec C

I find it quite impressive but still have a hard time justifying the price tag. In actuality I think a pen like the Ohto Celsus or the Lamy Safari can fit most refills people would ever want to use with small modifications. However, if you ever had the thought of getting something like the SwissRide refill in a fancy pen body this is the answer. You don‚Äôt have to look at the ugly plastic body of the 888 Infinity

1,"Can you sense substantial difference between cheap and expensive fountain pen? I'm pretty new in fp club so I had only Pilot V Pen and Lamy Safari. I think that maybe I don't really like triangle handler on Safari even if before I thought it'll be pretty good that I don't need to adjust my hand when writing. In the end I liked metal holding on TWISBI 580 pens but for price of $100 I can buy pens like Custom 74, Platinum 3776 and Sailor 1911 Promenade. One problem - I can only order them and don't have ability to write with each other to decide what pen I like more and if it's worth it. Other problem is that I don't really write anything outside of my college and morning journals but I think if I'll write with better for me pen than I'll write more like some kind of Zettlekasten or just thoughts about anything and then write them in my digital notes.

Firstly what I can tell is that I think my Safari is somehow scratchy which I don't really like. I don't think I'll like really smooth pens too because I'm kinda tactile person myself (I like tactile switches for instance). I heard that Sailor and Platinum pens are kind of like pencil so maybe one of them are my best bet.

So, in the end two questions:

1) Are these pens really can feel so much different that with one you will feel like you don't want to write and with other it's other story? My most priority is the feeling of holding pen and writing with it so design isn't that important. I just think that metal grip would be much better for the feeling of holding the pen than plastic I guess. Again, only tried Safari and TWSBI 580 and liked to hold second much more.

2) What would you recommend more of the pens I listed? I have big hands and writing so I feel like M size nibs are pretty great for me. I'm mostly debating about 1911 and 3776 but some people here saying that 1911 is more pencil like and others are saying the same about 3776. They're priced the same so I don't know in what I can believe. In worst case scenario I can buy both and sell the one that I didn't like the most but it is the worst case scenario.

0,"Little Pen/Ink comparison Shmidt: From my Scriveiner pen. Rolls very smooth, minimal skips once it's been broken in, and produces nice deep black ink. Looks very professional 
Pilot G2: Well everyone has probably used a G2 at SOME point in their lives. VERY smooth and consistent. Extremely reliable 
Sharpie S-Gel: I was very surprised the 1st time I used this. It's on par with a G2 and the grip is VERY comfortable with a very satisfying click. Writes very smooth
Pilot Retro-Pop: NOT as impressed with the ink as the G2. It's a 1mm and kinda skips every now and then. The body is nice and, well, Retro! Feels nice in hand and satisfying twist top
Pilot Acroball: Immediately got the impression that it felt like writing with a pencil but in ink. Very sleek body and the .7mm ink feels like .5mm. Not as smooth but will be precise
Uniball Vision Elite. I LOVE the way this pen writes but I rarely use it because it smears SO easily! The ink is very thick and bold but takes forever to dry. Ultra smooth and comfortable writing experience though."

I think the most frequent complaint about these pens is the lack of nib sizes and maybe Moonman is about to tip their hand and provide nib choices, at least Fine &amp; Medium.

It‚Äôs also surprisingly heavy but I‚Äôm 5 foot nothing so that‚Äôs probably partially because my hands are small but it‚Äôs still not too heavy to use. Speaking of my hands I‚Äôve already gotten used to them being stained with pen ink.

The Leuchtturm paper in the A4 notebook could be better because there is some ghosting but it‚Äôs definitely not to the point the notebook is unusable. When I finish this A4 one I might just get their 120 gsm version. The main reason I wanted the Leuchtturm A4 was cause of the size and number of pages. I‚Äôve been looking and I can‚Äôt seem to find any other A4 notebooks with as many pages as the Leuchtturm A4 (235) . So if y‚Äôall have any recommendations I‚Äôd appreciate it.

- Michael Corleone

Today‚Äôs writing included my plan for an exit strategy. I know people have a no buy year or some plan to buy less than set number of pens a year. But this doesn‚Äôt rule out purchasing more pens in the future entirely. Looking at the TWSBI i received recently and also some of the more expensive pens i own, the blatant truth is that i am now a collector when i started out as a user solely. This came to light when i saw that i have more pens i can use at a single time. 
The second truth was that many pens even affordable ones are over engineered to the extent they can last for many years. My TWSBI 580 seems indestructible if used normally. I don‚Äôt really need more pens. 
So cue the curtain rise for my exit strategy. I‚Äôve given myself till end of the year to buy any more pens i want. And i have set an arbitrary number of 5 or less. No more. 
I wrote this down in the journal after purchasing a Visconti Mythos Poseidon and realised during the post purchase high that i desperately needed an exit strategy. And then continue to enjoy the pleasure we all know so well using our pens daily to write. 
Does anyone have similar plans / experiences ? 
I possess a few advantages right off the bat - i don‚Äôt attend pen shows, i have become more particular about the pens i would like to own and i have in mind 3 more pens i would love to own but won‚Äôt break the bank.
